      The Ancient Americas, Curated | Collecting the “Other Americas”
    </title>

    <meta name="description" content="The term *pre-Columbian art* once described the material culture produced in the Americas, mostly south of the US-Mexico border, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Museums across the United States now refer to these departments as art of *the Americas* or *the ancient Americas*. Stewards of these collections in American art museums have begun confronting the changing meanings and import of what Nelson Rockefeller once described as the “other Americas.” This symposium volume captures the history of collecting and display of ancient American works in art museums, a history surprisingly poorly documented until now.">

                  The field of the ancient Americas, both as a discipline of
                  art-historical study and as a collecting department within art
                  museums in the United States, is comparatively young.
                  Initially grouped with the social sciences, the study of
                  ancient American aesthetics and culture emerged gradually.
                  While it is beyond the scope of this introduction to trace the
                  full history of the acquisition and display of these
                  collections within US art museums, this volume is the first to
                  bring together intertwined and local histories. Through the
                  lens of twelve art museums, this volume offers a broad
                  introduction to some of the key events, exhibitions,
                  historical context, and, particularly, the people from the end
                  of the nineteenth century to the present day that shaped this
                  history. While recent initiatives and volumes have brought new
                  focus on individual collectors of ancient American works, the
                  story of their acquisition and public display within art
                  museums is almost completely untold.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  There is not even a comprehensive list, as exists in other
                  fields, of all the institutions that hold works in this
                  area.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ancient Americas collections discussed here represent the
                  material output of communities living <em>south</em> of the
                  US-Mexico border, made prior to the arrival of Europeans.
                  Within the United States, this material has always been
                  temporally and geographically defined, rooted in the past, and
                  interpreted through a European lens. Previously referred to as
                  “primitive,” “Indian,” “pre-Columbian,” “prehispanic,” or “New
                  World,” the preferred term today for this material is “ancient
                  American.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  This is admittedly imprecise, as the term “ancient” for the
                  European past refers to a period ending about 400 CE, whereas
                  the “ancient Americas” encompasses works made prior to the
                  arrival of Europeans in the Americas, over a millennium later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following essays describe how ancient American art has
                  been collected, exhibited, and, more broadly, how American
                  <em>art</em> museums constructed, and shaped, public
                  perception of its meaning from the nineteenth century to the
                  present.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Even though the formation and functions of art museums have
                  changed over time, here we think of art museums as having “a
                  basic skeleton of three principal functions: collection,
                  research, and public programs.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  In very general terms, museum personnel was responsible for
                  prioritizing the works’ aesthetic qualities over historical
                  importance and other factors, for making those works available
                  to scholars (and, occasionally, to the general public) for
                  study and artistic inspiration, and for organizing
                  exhibitions, publications, and lectures aimed at general and
                  scholarly audiences. Like libraries and archives, museums
                  serve as memory institutions, sites where cultural and
                  historical memories are preserved through a distinct
                  interpretive lens. Yet this framing has shifted many times
                  over the late nineteenth century through the twenty-first.
                  Recently, scholars have reevaluated the processes of narration
                  and the resignification of objects in museum exhibitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  As interdisciplinary scholar James Clifford has remarked,
                  museums are “contact zones . . . as a collection becomes an
                  ongoing historical, political, moral <em>relationship</em>—a
                  power-charged set of exchanges, of push and pull.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  That push and pull extends even to the terms used to refer to
                  this art. In this volume, authors use different terms to
                  describe museum collections, a reflection of this material’s
                  marginalized status within the field of greater art history.
                  One of the more popular terms has been “primitive art.” The
                  term has no inherent meaning, rather as anthropologist Shelly
                  Errington makes clear, the word “primitive” acts as a foil for
                  the progressive nation-states of Western society. Anything, or
                  anyone, falling outside the narrative of progress is
                  interpreted as lesser than: underdeveloped, unsophisticated,
                  unambitious.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  The literary theorist Marianna Torgovnick has noted that the
                  term “primitive” implies an acceptance of “the West as norm
                  and . . . the rest as inferior, different, deviant,
                  subordinate, and subordinatable.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Initially, art historians applied the term to fourteenth- and
                  fifteenth-century European art, before the height of the
                  Renaissance; however, by the late nineteenth century, it would
                  refer exclusively to non-Western peoples, societies, and their
                  aesthetic creations. Within the art market, the term became
                  nearly codified as referring to people and works from Africa,
                  Oceania, and the ancient Americas, sometimes including Native
                  American peoples of the US but rarely including Asia. In other
                  words, the term became a shorthand for subjects, peoples, and
                  territories colonized by European imperial powers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The term “primitive” and its associations proved remarkably
                  durable, despite the fact that the cultures and communities
                  referred to rarely shared any geographic, cultural, or
                  linguistic connections. Academic institutions have long since
                  disregarded the fictive unifying principles of primitive art;
                  however, the concept has persisted in the museum
                  organizational structure because of the existence of
                  departments stewarding collections representing the arts of
                  Africa, Oceania, and the Ancient Americas (AOAA) were often
                  called Primitive Art departments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  A trope that unites the collections of these departments,
                  parodied by Errington in her book, is that of the “discovery
                  narrative,” a tale that recounts how people of note (she cites
                  the case of the artist Pablo Picasso) “discover” primitive
                  art, “rescue” it from obscurity, and “elevate” it so it can be
                  celebrated within the realm of “fine art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Art historian Susan Vogel and artist Fred Wilson similarly
                  have addressed and poked fun at the supposed transformation of
                  a primitive art object from artifact to art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>

                  While African and Oceanic (and at times Native American) art
                  have been called primitive, ancient American art has held a
                  unique place within this rubric. At different times, it has
                  been seen as primitive but also as the important production of
                  hemispheric neighbors, a uniquely American inspiration for
                  industrial design, and, in more recent years, an ancestral
                  source of inspiration and encouragement. Every museum’s
                  collection reflects these tensions and many other
                  considerations, including its financial resources, geographic
                  location, the historical moment(s) when it was collecting,
                  personnel working at a given time, and mission. The ten
                  chapters in this volume show how historical and cultural
                  factors have affected ancient American art’s inclusion and
                  framing within art museums and, ultimately, within the field
                  of art history. Not previously synthetically described or
                  analyzed, these four overarching factors include: the rise of
                  modernism, the use of ancient American motifs and techniques
                  for industrial design inspiration, <em>Indigenismo</em> in
                  Latin America and the United States, and Pan-Americanist
                  policies.

                  The Role of Modernism in the Acceptance of Ancient American
                  Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                  By the late nineteenth and especially early twentieth
                  centuries, there was a broader understanding of what
                  constituted fine art. The rise of photography meant that
                  mimetic realism no longer had to be the goal of art.
                  Accordingly, many artists began looking elsewhere for
                  inspiration and artistic goals. Many European modernists,
                  notably Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) and his circle, sought
                  inspiration in African art, but others also looked to ancient
                  American models. Art historian and archaeologist Barbara Braun
                  points to a range of international artists who were inspired
                  by these works for reasons of heritage, intellectual
                  curiosity, or aesthetic preference.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The leap from artifact to <em>objet d’art</em> resulted from
                  fundamental shifts in signification that occurred during the
                  nineteenth century when ancient American collections ceased to
                  be the exclusive province of natural history museums. A 1912
                  exhibition of Maya works at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,
                  has long been assumed to be the first presentation of these
                  works <em>as art</em> in an American art museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Although it included approximately one hundred items from
                  Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, the
                  notice of the exhibition was only one-and-a-half pages long
                  and was situated between longer articles that enthused over
                  the acquisition of a single Chinese artwork.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  The notice was written by the exhibition’s curator, Alfred
                  Marston Tozzer, a Harvard anthropologist. Tozzer closed the
                  notice by explaining that the exhibition would “show visitors
                  ignorant of the field of American archaeology that there was
                  something in this country in pre-Columbian times worthy of the
                  name of art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  As anthropology museums became popular with modern artists,
                  the works they contained became sources of artistic
                  inspiration. For example, American artist Max Weber
                  (1881–1961) composed an ode to a Chac Mool figure at the
                  American Museum of Natural History.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  British critic Roger Fry, who was a champion of European
                  modernism, was also cited by Braun and others as key to
                  changing attitudes about ancient American works. Fry greatly
                  influenced artist Henry Moore (1898–1986) to embrace ancient
                  American forms, particularly through his essay “American
                  Archaeology” that first appeared in November 1918. Here, Fry
                  observed that “it is only in this century that, after
                  considering them from every other point of view, we have begun
                  to look at [ancient American objects] seriously as works of
                  art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  In the 1920s, as Mexican Muralism, fed by ancient American
                  sources, gained popularity, Fry’s was one of the few available
                  essays by an art critic that was available to English-speaking
                  readers.

                  These readers could also become collectors. Though there was
                  no cultural affinity or connection between works from Africa,
                  Oceania, and the ancient Americas, they were often shown
                  together, and dealers of African art, including many mentioned
                  in this volume—Charles Ratton, Pierre Matisse, the Brummer
                  Galleries—sold works from the ancient Americas as well. These
                  merchants also often sold modern art and catered to those who
                  were interested in it. Indeed, it was these dealers, and later
                  curators, who promoted ancient American art within modernist
                  circles. Errington locates the emergence and
                  institutionalization of “authentic Primitive” art in the years
                  between 1935 and 1984.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  At the beginning of this period, in 1935, curator James
                  Johnson Sweeney organized the exhibition
                  <em>African Negro Art</em> at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).
                  He wrote of the vitality of the “plastic forms” of African
                  art, a term that would be applied over and over again to
                  ancient American works as well.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Those works that hewed closest to the ideal of the primitive
                  were often those with great formal simplicity. The more
                  stripped down and abstracted, the better. Those who created
                  such works could also be imagined to have extremely simple,
                  harmonious lives, to have lived in a former paradise as “noble
                  savages.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Sweeney would go on to an illustrious career, with his final
                  role as a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, where
                  he curated art of the Ancient Americas (see Koontz, this
                  volume.) Other modernist curators were also some of ancient
                  American art’s strongest champions. As Elizabeth Pope
                  discusses in her essay on the Art Institute of Chicago,
                  curator Katherine Kuh moved from organizing shows on José
                  Clemente Orozco (1883–1949) to collecting the ancient art that
                  had inspired him and other Latin American artists.

                  By the 1930s, some US museums were codifying the concept of
                  primitivism with the creation of curatorial departments that
                  oversaw these culturally unaffiliated regions of Africa,
                  Oceania, Ancient Americas (and sometimes including the
                  addition of Native American art). The Metropolitan Museum of
                  Art’s collection began as part of the Museum of Primitive Art
                  (see Pillsbury, this volume), and both the Cleveland and
                  Baltimore Museums of Art had departments known as “Primitive
                  art” (see Bergh and Hoobler, this volume). And while they did
                  not use the term “primitive” in their department names, the
                  Brooklyn Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago, as well as
                  many other US museums, used similar structures (see Rosoff and
                  Pope, this volume).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the increasing interest in ancient American art among
                  the promoters of modernism, it never exactly epitomized what
                  most considered primitive art. William Rubin, former director
                  of MoMA and curator of celebrated and reviled exhibitions on
                  this topic, felt that pre-Columbian art was more properly
                  called “courtly” or “theocratic” art along the lines of
                  ancient Egyptian and Persian art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  According to Rubin, ancient American works’ odd position
                  within primitivism was due to their naturalism, workmanship,
                  and fine finish, particularly the Maya carved stone stelae,
                  which exceeded what modern artists sought in primitive
                  art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  That is, although west Mexican ceramic figurines were embraced
                  by artists in Mexico and the US, other art traditions in the
                  Indigenous Americas, like Maya sculpture, were “too polished”
                  for collectors of primitive art. Despite its uneasy status as
                  primitive art—or maybe precisely because of it—many
                  institutions, including the Cleveland Museum of Art, the
                  Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and, surprisingly, the Museum of
                  Primitive Art in New York, actively sought Maya stelae for
                  their collections in the mid-twentieth century with an aim to
                  present them precisely as exquisite examples of artistic and
                  aesthetic achievement (see Bergh, Koontz, and Pillsbury, this
                  volume).

                  Ancient Indigenous Motifs as Source for American Industrial

                <p>
                  In fact, this aesthetic achievement was key to the collecting
                  and acceptance of works from the Indigenous Americas from the
                  late nineteenth to about the mid-twentieth centuries. The term
                  “ancient American art” includes work from a huge geographic
                  region, across thousands of years, and from numerous cultures.
                  Some works, like west Mexican figures, were ceramics that did
                  not seek to convey mimetic realism and whose details, to the
                  modern eye, appear imprecise and broadly painted. However,
                  many other art traditions, such as Colombian and Panamanian
                  gold, Andean textiles, and Mixtec and Nasca ceramics,
                  exemplify the highest virtuosity in their craftsmanship. Some
                  of the earliest collections of ancient American art chronicled
                  in this volume, including at The Metropolitan Museum, the
                  Brooklyn Museum, and the Baltimore Museum of Art, were amassed
                  with the idea that they would serve as sources of inspiration
                  for US fashion, textile, and industrial design (see Pillsbury,
                  Rosoff, and Hoobler, this volume).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Herbert Spinden, the curator at the Brooklyn Museum, observed
                  that national industrial design should “take its inspiration
                  from the materials, designs, and craftsmanship of the
                  indigenous peoples of the Americas, and with which Americans
                  could identify and be proud.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  As Lauren Whitley has written, the conclusion of the First
                  World War stimulated the interest in an American design
                  identity independent from Europe, prompting scholars such as
                  Morris de Camp Crawford to research museum collections and
                  create the textile industry’s “Designed in America” campaign
                  in conjunction with The Met, the American Museum of Natural
                  History, and <em>Women’s Wear</em> publications. The campaign
                  proved a training ground for young designers who took
                  inspiration from ancient Americas textiles, among other
                  cultural designs, housed at these institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>

                <h2><em>Indigenismo</em> in Latin America</h2>
                <p>
                  The Indigenous peoples of the Americas became an inspiration
                  to the newly minted republics across Latin America. As
                  boundaries were redrawn and independent economies developed,
                  the nascent formation of national identity and consciousness
                  took place simultaneously. How to represent the nation on the
                  world stage? How to reconcile the many communities living
                  therein: Indigenous (Native ethnic groups), mestizos
                  (mixed-race peoples), and <em>criollos</em> (mostly white
                  descendants of Spanish colonists)? As the nineteenth century
                  progressed, criollos across Latin America began to see the
                  “Indian” as the “bedrock of a nation.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  Art historian Natalia Majluf’s critical examination of
                  Francisco Laso’s <em>oeuvre</em>, for example, demonstrates
                  how Indigenous imagery became integral to the forging of a
                  national identity rooted in the Indigenous communities of
                  Peru, heirs to the ancient peoples of that land.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Eventually, this focus on Indigenous peoples of Latin America
                  evolved into <em>indigenismo</em>, an ideology that focused on
                  “describing, explaining, and designing public policies for
                  [Native] ethnic groups.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  Indigenismo took many forms across the region, even within a
                  single country.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Sociopolitically, policies ranged from beneficial reforms
                  promoting greater participation of Indigenous members to
                  full-scale assimilation into a modernized society. Culturally,
                  indigenismo valorized Indigenous artisans and their materials,
                  techniques, and style. By celebrating and aestheticizing
                  Indigenous-made objects and textiles, Latin American
                  intellectuals and artists characterized these works as the
                  singular legacy of the intellectual and technological
                  achievements of the prehispanic peoples, giving visibility to
                  oft-ignored communities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A single definition of indigenismo cannot be offered because
                  its expression within sociopolitical and cultural realms
                  diverged greatly.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  Over the course of the next eight decades, this nuanced, and
                  often fraught, ideology would undergo various evolutions,
                  especially between 1920 and 1930 and again in the 1950s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Latin American artists would play a critical role in
                  disseminating the perceived importance of ancient American
                  culture within their own countries and transnationally,
                  eventually making an impact on their northerly neighbor, the
                  United States. The indigenismo that would be exported,
                  however, would bring with it the many inherent contradictions
                  and paradoxes that developed alongside it.

                <p>
                  Following the Mexican Revolution, artists like Orozco, Diego
                  Rivera (1886–1957), and David Alfaro Siqueiros (1896–1974)
                  promoted Indigenous visual imagery from the ancient Americas
                  as an integral part of Mexico’s national identity. Siqueiros
                  memorialized this idea in his 1923 manifesto, asserting, “The
                  art of the Mexican people is the most important and vital
                  spiritual manifestation in the world today, and its Indian
                  traditions lie at its very heart.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Similarly, Colombia’s Luis Alberto Acuña (1904–1994), who
                  published the first monograph of Colombia’s “Indian” art,
                  promoted a Native art history rooted in Colombia’s
                  pre-Columbian past.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Peru’s José Carlos Mariátegui (1894–1930), founder and editor
                  of the periodical <em>Amauta</em>, and his collaborator,
                  artist José Sabogal (1880–1956), promoted Indigenous heritage
                  as that which distinguished Latin America from Europe. When
                  asked about his preference for Indigenous inspiration, Sabogal
                  responded, “Why yes we are cultural
                  <em>indigenistas</em> because we look for an integral identity
                  with our soil, its humanity and our time.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  <em>Amauta</em>, a Quechua word that translates to
                  <em>maestro</em> or counselor, exemplifies Mariátegui’s
                  privileging of the Indigenous perspective as he simultaneously
                  forged a pan-American space for the avant-garde.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Artists, poets, and intellectuals of the 1920s and ’30s mined
                  the iconography and visual imagery of pre-Columbian cultures
                  to depict the glories of their regional, ancient pasts and at
                  the same time to signal their new nations’ unique modernity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite its brief life (1926–30), Mariátegui’s journal
                  presaged an interest in forging transnational connections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  Politically, this was realized during the first Inter-American
                  Conference on Indian Life, in Pátzcuaro, Michoacán. Its
                  principal objectives were “to comprehensively improve the life
                  of the indigenous groups of America” and to “uphold and defend
                  their cultural particularities.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  At the conference, Mexico founded the Instituto Indigenista
                  Inter-Americano (IIIA) and named Moisés Sáenz its inaugural
                  director. Sáenz promoted cultural plurality and integration
                  and advocated those representatives from Indigenous
                  communities be present at the conference; however, after
                  Sáenz’s sudden death, anthropologist Manuel Gamio replaced
                  him. Gamio instituted an “apolitical and scientific” approach
                  to indigenismo: in other words, a modern ethnography that
                  excluded Indigenous voices from the conversation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  Despite the desire to preserve and promote Indigenous culture
                  as part of a modern, national dialogue, the actual material
                  conditions of contemporary Indigenous communities did not see
                  similar support and modernization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  The IIIA would go on to found its own periodical,
                  <em>América Indígena</em>, whose imagery and graphics would be
                  foundational in creating an “an inter-American indigenist
                  imaginary.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  As anthropologist Deborah Dorotinsky has argued, the nature of
                  the editorial design, logo, and the choice of illustrative
                  woodprints created a certain uniformity in the depiction of
                  Indigenous peoples across the Americas, counteracting the
                  supposed objective of the larger indigenismo movements in both
                  the political and cultural sphere.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  This would have ramifications in continental policies, and as
                  other scholars have noted, this would influence the display
                  and presentation of ancient American- and Indigenous-made art
                  within the museum space.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The embrace of Indigenous cultures by modern Latin American
                  artists furthered the link between ancient American art and
                  modernism. Not only did they adopt the visual vocabularies of
                  the ancient past, but they also began collecting works for
                  their own artistic inspiration and enjoyment. As works by the
                  Mexican muralists became desirable for collectors and
                  influential for the burgeoning abstract artists in the US
                  during the mid-twentieth century, ancient American objects
                  became even more attractive to collectors and institutions
                  outside of Latin America.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Leading proponents of indigenismo such as Miguel Covarrubias
                  (1904–1957) would have an outsize influence on the
                  presentation of ancient American material in the United States
                  both through publications—content as well as editorial
                  design—and in museum exhibitions such as
                  <em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em> at MoMA. They
                  imparted their pride for the Indigenous-made materials of
                  their homelands but conversely brought an idealized, and
                  falsely homogenized, understanding of what Indigenous
                  community life was like.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>The Rise of Pan-Americanism</h2>
                <p>
                  The final development that influenced the popularization of
                  ancient American art in US art collections was the political
                  movement known as Pan-Americanism. The embrace of ancient
                  American art by Latin Americans, and then by US artists,
                  coincided with several geopolitical trends that turned the
                  United States’ attention toward Latin America. Pan-Americanism
                  saw two periods of popularity in the nineteenth and twentieth
                  centuries, corresponding to greater US interest in strategic
                  alliances with Latin America. The term was first used in
                  reference to the independent nations of the Americas in the
                  context of the First International American Conference of
                  American States, held in Washington, DC, in 1889–90.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Part of this first wave, which reached its apogee with the end
                  of World War I, was an interest in Latin American antiquities.
                  It encompassed the belief that the societies of ancient Latin
                  America might offer a more peaceful and beautiful alternative
                  to recent experience. British critic Roger Fry (cited above)
                  championed this view, as well as art historian Walter Pach
                  (1883–1958). One of the organizers of the 1913 Armory Show,
                  also known as the International Exhibition of Modern Art, Pach
                  was an important champion of Indigenous American art from the
                  United States and particularly from south of the US
                  border.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another important driver of this early version of
                  Pan-Americanism and accompanying interest in the arts of the
                  ancient Americas was a series of World’s Fairs in the late
                  nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These represented
                  opportunities for countries to share their visual culture with
                  the public and with US museums, which sometimes bought or
                  accepted examples of ancient American art at the conclusion of
                  the fair. The fairs’ visitors experienced authentic works of
                  art and material culture as well as replicas, such as the
                  plaster casts of the Labná arch, a monumental Maya gateway
                  from western Yucatan that was a star attraction at the 1893
                  Chicago World Columbian Exposition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it is the Pan-Americanism that became politically, and
                  later aesthetically, institutionalized in the 1930s through
                  the 1950s that is much better known. Pan-Americanism
                  intertwined with modern art by the early 1930s, as certain
                  major exhibitions, notably MoMA’s 1933
                  <em>American Sources of Modern Art</em>, juxtaposed ancient
                  and modern works to highlight formal and subject-matter
                  similarities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  Beginning in the 1930s, some US politicians began to cite an
                  ideal of Pan-Americanism related to the unity of the nations
                  of the Western hemisphere. In the same year as
                  <em>American Sources</em>, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Good
                  Neighbor Policy espoused ideals of nonintervention and legal
                  equality among these nations to promote cooperation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even as many resisted accepting a broader hemispheric past or
                  cultural unity, there were strategic interests at work. By the
                  late 1930s, Mexico and Latin America were becoming of greater
                  strategic importance as the winds of World War II began to
                  blow. The Office of Inter-American Affairs (OIAA), originally
                  the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs
                  (CIAA), was active between 1941 and 1946 and headed by Nelson
                  Rockefeller (see Pillsbury, this volume). Rockefeller’s
                  curator, René d’Harnoncourt, directed the Art Section of the
                  CIAA and coordinated a large number of exhibitions that sought
                  to show Latin American nations as worthy allies with
                  sophisticated and intriguing cultures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  These smaller Pan-American exhibitions contained folk art,
                  modern art, even toys and utilitarian objects, but they often
                  also included ancient art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the most successful such exhibitions, much larger and
                  more complex than the ones described above, was jointly
                  organized between MoMA and the Mexican government—<em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em>
                  in 1940.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  As its title suggests, the show brought together art from four
                  categories: pre-Spanish, colonial, folk, and modern art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  It was co-organized by archaeologist Alfonso Caso (1896–1970)
                  and the artist Covarrubias, whose illustrations, cartoons, and
                  paintings of heroic Indigenous peoples of the Americas would
                  fill popular books he authored on the subject.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  Both he and Roberto Montenegro (1887–1968), curator of the
                  folk art section, frequently depicted and drew inspiration
                  from ancient American art, which they also collected and
                  occasionally sold.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  The exhibition was held at a nadir of US-Mexico relations in
                  the wake of the expropriation of Mexico’s oil resources and
                  played a key role in smoothing strained relations between the
                  two nations. It also pointed to how Pan-Americanism could help
                  with the commercialization of the ancient American past—the
                  New York department store Macy’s sold works of modern art by
                  Orozco and Siqueiros, as well as replicas of ancient Mexican
                  gold, of the kind shown in the exhibition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  They were, however, bested by Gimbel’s, a few blocks away,
                  which sold actual ancient works from Peru in the same
                  year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While <em>Twenty Centuries</em> marked a highwater mark of
                  Pan-American exhibitions, it was far from the last. Shortly
                  after, Herbert Spinden, of the Brooklyn Museum, embarked on a
                  six-month speaking tour through Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and
                  Argentina. Spinden took the occasion to collect and accession
                  about 1,400 objects from eight Latin American countries. Many
                  of these were immediately included in the 1941–42 presentation
                  <em>America South of U.S.</em> at the Brooklyn Museum, while
                  others were included in six exhibitions that Brooklyn
                  organized for the CIAA (three on ancient American themes and
                  three on colonial and folk art). According to curator Diana
                  Fane, “These exhibitions toured schools and public
                  institutions throughout the United States for more than a
                  decade starting in 1942.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  While these exhibitions can be read as a barometer of the
                  rising status of ancient American art within museums at the
                  time, they also signal its falling. As the Brooklyn Museum’s
                  Chief Curator Kevin Stayton mused about Spinden, “It’s not an
                  accident that we sent an expedition in 1941. This was a
                  last-ditch effort to weave together the Americas and ignore
                  Europe during World War II, at a time we thought we could
                  still get away with that. . . . And it is also no accident
                  that the collection disappeared into our storerooms when
                  achieving hemispheric unity receded in importance.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  During 1944–45, Rockefeller sent d’Harnoncourt on a
                  two-and-a-half-month tour of Latin America that included
                  visits to Mexico, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil in order
                  to “undertake a careful survey and prepare a report for this
                  Office on propaganda activities being carried out by foreign
                  powers in the other American republics.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  The OIAA was concerned about developing trends and how best to
                  prepare for the postwar political landscape. But by the 1950s,
                  the US-Mexico relationship had irrevocably changed, and the
                  spirit of Pan-Americanism began to wane. Postwar US power on
                  the world stage had become great enough that it did not need
                  to seek the same strategic, cultural alliances with Mexico
                  that it once had. Interest in organizing international
                  traveling exhibitions focused on the ancient Americas would
                  diminish until the mid-1980s and ’90s, when the North American
                  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) began to be drafted and
                  ultimately passed, and major Latin American exhibitions were
                  mounted with cooperation and support from nations of the
                  region.

                  In response to the important trade relations in the American
                  continent as well as the burgeoning Latine population in the
                  United States, several notable large-scale exhibitions have
                  resulted from international collaborations in the first
                  decades of the twenty-first century. The Los Angeles County
                  Museum of Art (LACMA) stands out as having organized the
                  lion’s share of exhibitions, including
                  <em>Lords of Creation: The Origins of Sacred Maya Kingship</em>
                  (2006),
                  <em>Olmec: Colossal Masterworks of Ancient Mexico</em>
                  (2010–11),
                  <em>Contested Visions in the Spanish Colonial World</em>
                  (2011–12),
                  <em>Children of the Plumed Serpent: The Legacy of Quetzalcoatl
                    in Ancient Mexico</em>
                  (2012),
                  <em>The Portable Universe: Thought and Splendor of Indigenous
                    Colombia</em>
                  (2022), and most recently,
                  <em>We Live in Painting: The Nature of Color in Mesoamerican
                    Art</em>
                  (2024–25). Perhaps because of its position on the West Coast,
                  a region, and specifically a city, with deep ties to Latin
                  America, or because of the strength and vision of its
                  curators—Virginia Fields (1989–2011), Ilona Katzew
                  (2000–present), Diana Magaloni (2013–present)—or support by
                  its director, Michael Govan (2006–present), LACMA-organized
                  exhibitions challenged the field of Ancient Americas to grow
                  beyond its original parameters. By far the most complex and
                  ambitious exhibition of the ancient Americas to date was
                  <em>Golden Kingdoms: Luxury and Legacy in the Ancient
                    Americas</em>
                  (2017–18), a collaboration between the Getty Museum and The
                  Met, curated by Joanne Pillsbury, Tim Potts, and Kim Richter,
                  that involved numerous Latin American countries. Today, the
                  ability to mount such ambitious international collaborations
                  going forward is in doubt. The financial and diplomatic
                  resources necessary for such undertakings are in increasingly
                  short supply.

                <h2>History of the Project</h2>
                <p>
                  This volume arose from our own shared interest in the history
                  of collections and a desire to understand the threads, both
                  personal and historical, that connected institutions and
                  collections to one another. As curators, we were interested in
                  the modes of display and the interpretive frameworks applied
                  to ancient material from Latin America. We asked ourselves why
                  collections on the West Coast looked so different from those
                  on the East Coast. What determined the nature and character of
                  different institutional holdings?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inspired by published histories on the development and
                  representation of other “non-Western” collections that
                  considered both the acquisition and display of Native American
                  and African art, we sought a similar synthetic treatment for
                  the ancient Americas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  We found none. In 2017, no volume on the origins of ancient
                  American art in US art museums existed. Interest in the
                  connections between collections, museums, and diplomacy appear
                  in Elizabeth Hill Boone’s edited volume,
                  <em>Collecting the Pre-Columbian Past</em> (1993),
                  specifically Holly Barnet-Sánchez’s pivotal essay on the 1940
                  exhibition at MoMA, and in Shelly Errington’s
                  <em>The Death of Authentic Primitive Art and Other Tales of
                    Progress</em>
                  (1998). Errington addressed key periods of collecting and
                  exhibition design, especially the impact of display techniques
                  and the national rhetoric around pre-Columbian cultures and
                  their political role for US-Latin American relations during
                  the interwar and postwar periods.

                  We had each begun investigating specific collections and
                  institutions and saw how the histories of these collections
                  might be held as a mirror to broader institutional and
                  regional histories. Our growing interest in the topic happily
                  coincided with two key recent developments in pre-Columbian
                  art history: the appointment of Mary Miller as director of the
                  Getty Research Institute and her development of the
                  Pre-Hispanic Provenance Initiative (PHAPI) and several art
                  museums across the United States deciding to reinstall their
                  ancient Americas collections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  This confluence of events provided a moment to reflect and
                  reconsider the institutional histories of these collections:
                  both the lives and representations of objects as well as the
                  ways in which these works have been used to represent Latin
                  American national identity historically and the Latine
                  communities’ growing interest in these collections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2019, the Walters Art Museum invited a number of ancient
                  Americas curators from US art museums, who were in different
                  phases of reinstallation, to workshop ideas and/or report on
                  their approaches. The success of those conversations resulted
                  in the 2023 symposium at the Denver Art Museum. All symposium
                  participants hold or have held positions in curatorial
                  departments in the museums whose history they describe. Thus,
                  their essays reflect both their knowledge of the field and
                  their specific institutional experiences. The organization of
                  the essays follows both a chronological and geographic arc
                  beginning with Nancy Rosoff’s saga of the Brooklyn Museum’s
                  diverse holdings and ending with Kristopher Driggers’s history
                  of the Tucson Museum of Art’s collection. Mary Miller provides
                  a coda of sorts, exploring the business ventures of gallerist
                  Earl Stendahl and his family, which impacted so many of the
                  collections discussed here. While not all of the most
                  important collections of ancient American material in the
                  United States are represented within this volume, including
                  those at LACMA, the de Young Museum, the Detroit Institute of
                  Art, and the Dallas Museum of Art, the histories detailed here
                  represent a substantial overview of the evolution of the field
                  itself and collecting practices. Additionally, tracing the
                  shifting position of the ancient Americas within US art
                  museums offers crucial insights into museums’ own existential
                  struggles as we come to terms with our colonial histories and
                  make room for other perspectives and voices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If museums are memory institutions, the keepers of national,
                  cultural, and even global histories, curators are carriers of
                  living memory for those institutions, communicating published
                  and unspoken norms and standards that have shifted radically
                  over the past few decades. In a specialty that has such a
                  short history, retirement or death means the loss of ephemeral
                  knowledge, memories about collection histories, donors, and
                  the vicissitudes of institutional histories. The recent losses
                  of pioneering curators Julie Jones at The Met, in 2021, and
                  Diana Fane at the Brooklyn Museum, in 2024, made the need to
                  capture the histories of these collections, remembered and
                  known by the current generation of curators, all the more
                  pressing. Jones began at the Museum of Primitive Art (MPA) in
                  1960 as an intern and was eventually promoted to curator in
                  1974. After the MPA collection was given to The Met, she
                  stayed with the collection and shepherded its transition,
                  overseeing the building and installation of the Rockefeller
                  Wing, which opened in 1982. Fane was one of the first
                  professionally trained curators in pre-Columbian art history,
                  having received her doctorate from Columbia University. After
                  working for three years at The Met with Jones, she began her
                  career at the Brooklyn Museum in 1979 and served there
                  twenty-one years before retiring. With their passing, the
                  field has been deprived of a fuller accounting of their
                  memories and wisdom and their perspective on the field’s
                  origins and evolution. They were the last generation to have
                  personal reminiscences of the field’s earliest influencers—the
                  first professional scholars and dealers in this field, such as
                  Gordon Ekholm, Junius Bird, and John Wise. This volume
                  represents our attempt to reconstruct and preserve the
                  memories of these collections and honor the work of those who
                  came before us. May the book provide a pathway forward for the
                  next generation.

                        was the volume edited by Elizabeth Hill Boone,
                        <em>Collecting the Pre-Columbian Past: A Symposium at

                        Today, Mexican academics and institutions refer to
                        contemporary Indigenous communities as
                        <em>pueblos originarios</em>, or original peoples, a
                        term akin Canada’s “First Nations.” For a longer
                        discussion of the term, see Itzel Vargas Plata, “Los
                        Huecos del agua: arte actual de los pueblos
                        originarios,” in
                        <em>Los Huecos del agua: arte actual de los pueblos

                        (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, 2021).
                        Similarly, some American institutions have adopted the
                        term “Ancestral Americas” to connect these collections
                        to present-day peoples. See Diana Magaloni, Davide
                        Dominici, and Alyce de Carteret, eds.,
                        <em>We Live in Painting: The Nature of Color in
                          Mesoamerican Art</em>

                        2024). The term “ancestral” blurs the temporal division
                        that the term “ancient” underscores: the ancient past as
                        separate from the present. Furthermore, it can serve as
                        a more inclusive term that welcomes descendant
                        communities on both sides of the border who cannot trace
                        a direct line back to their Indigenous ancestors.

                        even in 2024, is not a complete one. While many ancient
                        American works are now in art museums, others remain in
                        natural history or anthropological institutions,
                        including the American Museum of Natural History (New
                        York), National Museum of Natural History (Washington,
                        DC), Field Museum (Chicago), and Natural History Museum

                        entirely disconnected from the ground floor collections.
                        Furthermore, the objects presented on the second floor
                        were “employed as accessories for posed mannequins
