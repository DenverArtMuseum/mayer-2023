      James Johnson Sweeney and the Discovery of the “Other Americas” in 1960s
      Houston | Collecting the “Other Americas”
    </title>

    <meta name="description" content="The term *pre-Columbian art* once described the material culture produced in the Americas, mostly south of the US-Mexico border, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Museums across the United States now refer to these departments as art of *the Americas* or *the ancient Americas*. Stewards of these collections in American art museums have begun confronting the changing meanings and import of what Nelson Rockefeller once described as the “other Americas.” This symposium volume captures the history of collecting and display of ancient American works in art museums, a history surprisingly poorly documented until now.">

                <p>
                  Although what would become the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston
                  (MFAH), was established early in the twentieth century and
                  found a permanent home in a neoclassical building by 1924, the
                  MFAH was not early to the collecting or display of ancient
                  American art. The museum’s initial relationship with that art
                  began in earnest in the early 1960s, under the guidance of the
                  recently appointed director of the museum, James Johnson
                  Sweeney (1900–1986; fig. 1). Although central to the creation
                  of an ancient American collection, Sweeney was not a scholar
                  of the ancient Americas but a seasoned curator of modern art
                  who had amassed a significant reputation in that area. Well
                  before his arrival in Houston, Sweeney was committed to a view
                  of non-Western art that highlighted that art’s utility to the
                  contemporary project of constructing a modernist visual
                  vocabulary. The initial impulse to collect and exhibit
                  seriously in this area was shaped to some extent by Sweeney’s
                  modernist commitments, certainly, but it was also as a way to
                  garner national attention for the museum as the decade of the
                  1960s opened and Sweeney arrived from New York. These
                  institutional goals drove the initial collecting of ancient
                  American art as much or more than any scholarly concerns such
                  as wide coverage of ancient American regional traditions or
                  building deep collections in specific areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  Before Sweeney: The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, in 1961
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Before 1961 and Sweeney’s arrival as director, the MFAH’s
                  ancient American collections consisted of a donation of one
                  west Mexican ceramic sculpture given by John (1904–1973) and
                  Dominique (1908–1997) de Menil along with a number of small
                  ceramic and stone figures from Mesoamerica. By the time
                  Sweeney left the director position in 1967, the ancient
                  American collection included several hundred objects, mostly
                  from Mesoamerica, including a handful of what would be
                  considered masterworks. The museum also held one major
                  international exhibition of ancient American art,
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em>, discussed below, as well as an
                  extensive exhibition highlighting the growth in the permanent
                  collection. Sweeney achieved this remarkable growth in ancient
                  American art collecting and display without the aid of a
                  curator in the area. The first curator of ancient American art
                  at the MFAH wouldn’t arrive until twenty years later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What gave Sweeney the cachet—if not the expertise—to transform
                  the ancient American collections at the MFAH? James Johnson
                  Sweeney was considered a major force in the New York art world
                  for decades before his arrival in Houston. He had done
                  extensive curatorial work at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)
                  in its early years, creating important exhibitions between
                  1935 and 1946. He was briefly the head of painting and
                  sculpture at MoMA in 1945–46. More important for this context,
                  however, was his long run as the director of the Guggenheim
                  Museum, beginning in 1952 and ending in 1960, shortly before
                  he took up the directorship of the MFAH. It was Sweeney who
                  oversaw the construction of the Frank Lloyd Wright building
                  for the Guggenheim, and he installed the first exhibitions in
                  that new, idiosyncratic space. Soon after the Wright building
                  opened in late 1959, it became clear that Sweeney was unhappy
                  with the new space and other institutional constraints and
                  would be leaving.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Sensing an opening, important MFAH trustees John and Dominique
                  de Menil, who moved in similar New York circles, invited
                  Sweeney to consider the MFAH directorship. Sweeney would soon
                  assent, although it took almost a year for him to put things
                  in order and move to Houston, arriving only in 1961.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a long director search that seemed to be going nowhere,
                  the trustees were excited to have found someone of Sweeney’s
                  stature. John de Menil later called Sweeney “one of the most
                  famous museum directors, nationally and internationally.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  He and other trustees felt that the MFAH was in the midst of
                  significant change. The trustees were clearly in favor of a
                  much larger role for the museum on the national stage. The
                  search committee chair, S. I. Morris (1914–2006), framed
                  Sweeney’s hire as an “energetic plan to establish Houston as a
                  national center of the arts.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  As the museum press release on Sweeney’s hiring stated:
                  “[MFAH] should take its place as one of the significant
                  museums of the United States and of the world.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Sweeney’s charge, reiterated in no uncertain terms in
                  correspondence to the incoming director, was to put the MFAH
                  in the national and even international media discourse. In
                  sum, Sweeney was considered a cosmopolitan and a giant in the
                  US art world at a time when the MFAH trustees, led by John de
                  Menil, wanted to increase Houston’s notoriety in the larger
                  art world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While trustees saw Sweeney as a national figure in museum
                  administration that would increase the museum’s visibility and
                  prestige, Sweeney saw himself as much more than simply an
                  effective museum director. He was also a tastemaker.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  Sweeney was first and always an advocate for what he
                  considered the best, most advanced modern art—<em>The New York Times</em>
                  described him as “the arbiter of Modern Art” in a profile they
                  did on the eve of his move to Houston.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  He viewed the role of the museum as an elevating experience
                  for the viewer and was loath to focus on more purely didactic
                  opportunities with his exhibitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  The visual experience of the best modern art should be the
                  central focus of the museum, in Sweeney’s view.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Elevating taste, which was about developing discernment in the
                  viewer, was more important to Sweeney than art-historical
                  facts and sequences. Sweeney’s privileging of the cultivation
                  of taste over more pedagogical concerns was the deciding
                  factor in the split between the Guggenheim and Sweeney, with
                  the Guggenheim wanting a more robust education program and
                  Sweeney decidedly against such a development.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Sweeney was also against the ideal of the encyclopedic museum,
                  insofar as the optimal museum experience should consist of
                  seeing “not more than 150 paintings” and institutions should
                  be “as big as a bistro . . . and no bigger.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  In sum, Sweeney’s ideal museum was focused on an elevated
                  visual experience that moved the modernist discourse forward.
                  Much of the activity around ancient American art collecting
                  and display may be seen in this context.

                  In 1962, or within a year of settling in Houston, James
                  Johnson Sweeney used his discretionary fund—a newly created
                  fund that was a prerequisite for his coming to Houston—to
                  acquire a Classic Maya stone panel (fig. 2). There was nothing
                  remotely like this large and expertly carved low relief in the
                  museum collection, but such an acquisition at this time was
                  not unusual on a national level. The early 1960s saw other
                  Classic Maya pieces of similar quality enter various US public
                  collections, including Nelson Rockefeller’s Museum of
                  Primitive Art and a comparable stone panel from the same
                  region acquired by Dumbarton Oaks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  In the context of the MFAH, the acquisition of the Classic
                  Maya panel was the beginning for Sweeney’s activities in this
                  area.

                <p>
                  In the following year (1963), the museum mounted a major
                  special exhibition focused on Olmec art entitled
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em>. The show was one of the earliest
                  museum exhibitions in the US or Europe to focus on this
                  singular and fundamental Mesoamerican art tradition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Figure 3 shows the facade of Cullinan Hall during the run of
                  that show, when an original Olmec colossal head (San Lorenzo
                  Monument 2) stood immediately outside the new modernist hall.
                  The interior of the hall was filled with Olmec stone
                  sculpture, much of it borrowed from the Museo de Antropología
                  in Xalapa, Mexico (fig. 4).

                  Focusing on one region of Mesoamerica in an exhibition was an
                  unusual strategy for a US (or European) museum at this time.
                  One reason for this approach might be Sweeney’s known
                  preference for focused shows as opposed to sprawling
                  blockbuster exhibits.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  There were important countervailing forces to the idea of
                  focused exhibitions of ancient American art, however. Large
                  museum exhibitions featuring Mesoamerican art in the US and
                  Europe up to this point had insisted on stitching together a
                  Mexican national tradition, as seen in MoMA’s foundational
                  <em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em> in 1940. The
                  nationalist story is not just a MoMA or even a US penchant:
                  The MFAH archive reveals that, as late as March 1962, Mexican
                  officials were requesting that Sweeney widen the scope of the
                  show to include “other aspects of the development of Mexican
                  art through the Colonial Independence and Modern periods of
                  our country.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  For these correspondents, the nationalist frame had not
                  changed substantially from 1940 and the
                  <em>Twenty Centuries</em> exhibition to the early 1960s. To
                  search for a consistent nonnationalist message in recent
                  ancient American exhibitions (those of the 1950s and early
                  ’60s), one would have to look at smaller, market-driven
                  touring exhibitions like those organized by Stendhal Galleries
                  of Los Angeles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The blockbuster <em>Masterworks of Mexican Art</em> exhibition
                  traveling in Europe in the years immediately preceding
                  Sweeney’s <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> is a relevant case in
                  point. This show used the same nationalist (Mexican) lens seen
                  in the earlier MoMA exhibition to circumscribe the many
                  ancient American cultures in a larger national narrative.
                  Instead of exploring a specific Mesoamerican tradition in
                  depth, the nationalist show surveyed all pre-Conquest
                  traditions found on Mexican soil and then appended the
                  post-Conquest traditions, creating an all-encompassing
                  national art-historical narrative. An ultimate iteration of
                  <em>Masterworks of Ancient Mexican Art</em>, in Los Angeles,
                  also included an Olmec colossal head, San Lorenzo Monument 5,
                  that garnered much attention in the press and with attendees
                  in the same year as Sweeney’s exhibition (1963).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Instead of an exclusive focus on Olmec monumentality and the
                  primacy of Gulf Coast civilization as seen in Sweeney’s show,
                  the head was framed in the LA version of
                  <em>Masterworks</em> as a founding moment in a larger national
                  narrative of Mexican art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1964, the year after the Olmec exhibition, Sweeney again
                  deployed his director’s discretionary funds to acquire
                  important ancient American stone sculptures (<a href="(https:/emuseum.mfah.org/objects/133477/hieroglyphic-inscription-from-tablet-y?ctx=da188577bd238aedbe3cbf2ac9065d39c047f045&amp;idx=0)">MFAH 64.38-39</a>). These pieces were related to the Maya panel bought two
                  years earlier in general glyphic style, and it is very likely
                  that all three came from the western Maya region, abutting the
                  Gulf Coast and directly adjacent in space (but not in time) to
                  the material displayed in the Olmec show.

                  In the following year, the art of the ancient Americas takes
                  an important place in the museum’s permanent collection with
                  the gift of approximately two hundred Mesoamerican objects.
                  The donation of Mrs. Harry C. (Alice Nicholson) Hanszen
                  (1900–1977) included the Teotihuacan tripod vase (fig. 5), a
                  Classic Veracruz yoke (fig. 6), and a number of other
                  important pieces. The Hanszen donation contained fine examples
                  of ancient Gulf Coast art but was not limited to that region.
                  With the Hanszen gift as a sort of culmination, it is no
                  exaggeration to say that, after the first four years of
                  Sweeney’s tenure, the ancient American collections of the MFAH
                  had been completely transformed and that this transformation
                  had been driven by the director’s collecting habits and
                  exhibitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the Hanszen collection included objects from across
                  Mesoamerica, the most important initiatives involving ancient
                  American activities during Sweeney’s directorship revolved
                  around the Gulf Coast region of Mesoamerica. It is difficult
                  not to see a strategy of collecting and exhibiting what were
                  viewed at the time as the finest ancient Gulf Coast objects,
                  given the location of Houston and its rising regional
                  prominence. By 1961, the city of Houston was touted in the
                  popular press as one of the Gulf Coast’s largest ports and was
                  soon to be the largest city on the Gulf.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Although the institutional logic of a Gulf Coast thrust is
                  appealing, the archive and Sweeney’s public statements do not
                  indicate that such a regional focus played an important role
                  in his strategy in the early 1960s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While there is little archival evidence of a Gulf Coast
                  strategy, there is more evidence for a strong interest in the
                  larger category of ancient American art by Sweeney and the
                  museum. Sweeney left an alluring but somewhat vague set of
                  public statements on why ancient American art was such a key
                  part of his strategy to improve the profile of the museum. In
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> catalog, Sweeney stated that
                  “because of the closeness of Mexico to Houston, their
                  historical links, their present, close financial associations,
                  as well as Houston’s considerable Mexican population” the
                  museum should focus on the art of the region.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  The art critic Dore Ashton wrote in 1963 that Sweeney thought
                  the pre-Columbian tradition of the Southwest ought to be
                  highlighted in Texas (but leaves “Southwest” undefined).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  A prominent trustee even raised the possibility of the MFAH
                  becoming an “inter-American” museum, quoting Sweeney in this,
                  although little of substance seems to have come of this
                  idea.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  The archive does little to clarify these statements on
                  collecting and exhibiting ancient American art. To better
                  understand Sweeney’s strategy, it may be helpful to see his
                  ancient American strategies in the light of the larger
                  transformations under way at the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Factors at work in the MFAH’s shifting identity in the early
                  1960s include Sweeney’s sense of the future of museums and
                  important exhibitions outlined above and the new architectural
                  envelope that he was called to work on while in Houston (more
                  on this below). Although these factors may be seen as largely
                  extraneous to a knowledge of Mesoamerican art and its regional
                  traditions, they are important to our story because they were
                  of fundamental importance to many of the key actors.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  The incorporation of complex institutional histories into the
                  emergence of ancient American collecting and display requires
                  a larger frame of analysis, one that encompasses prestige
                  competition among museums, contemporary tastes in display
                  strategies, and art market considerations, among other
                  variables. Scholars have long justified this larger frame for
                  the study of early collecting and exhibition strategies in
                  major institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  Museum collections of ancient American art were (and are)
                  often “situated as much in the nexus of the chaos and energy
                  of cultural production as they are representative of rigidly
                  controlled hierarchies of aesthetics and taste,” in the words
                  of Matthew Robb, speaking of the construction of ancient
                  American collections more generally.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  In this case, the ambition for a larger national profile for
                  the MFAH as understood by the director and key trustees, none
                  of whom were versed in the ancient American art-historical
                  discourse, was crucial to the emergence of ancient American
                  art collecting and display in Houston.

                <p>
                  The construction of Cullinan Hall, opened in 1958 and seen
                  above in figures 3 and 4, gave trustees and other stakeholders
                  the feeling that the museum was ready to take its place on the
                  national stage. In relation to earlier construction, the
                  Cullinan was a bold modernist move. The original museum
                  building, finished by 1926, featured a stately neoclassical
                  facade and traditional interiors for the time (fig. 7). An
                  extension of the building in 1953 did little to change the
                  basic architectural character of the museum. Just three years
                  before Sweeney’s arrival, however, Mies van der Rohe’s
                  Cullinan Hall had been added to the original building, adding
                  a soaring interior space along with the modernist facade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is difficult to exaggerate the radical nature of Cullinan
                  Hall’s architecture in Houston at this time. The hall was one
                  extended volume of approximately 10,000 square feet. The
                  ceiling was anchored by steel plate girders that were 5 feet
                  deep and 82 feet long, fanning out to bridge a 30-foot-high
                  interior ceiling. The north facade featured dramatic
                  floor-to-ceiling windows, and a Venetian terrazzo floor
                  effectively grounded the interior space.

                <p>
                  Before Sweeney’s arrival, the critic Eleanor Munro, writing in
                  1959, in <em>ArtNews</em>, distilled the situation for any
                  curator bold enough to step into the space: Cullinan was a
                  “grey-glass walled cell of empty space set as a kind of
                  haughty challenge by architects to the arts of painting and
                  sculpture.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Sweeney was well aware of the architectural challenge before
                  accepting the director position. On arriving in Houston,
                  Sweeney himself wryly noted, “I have had a little experience
                  with difficult buildings.” This was surely a reference to his
                  recent time at the Guggenheim, overseeing the building and
                  installation in Frank Lloyd Wright’s iconic space, which
                  Sweeney ended up detesting. Sweeney continued about Cullinan
                  Hall: “I admire Mies and find his hall inviting by
                  comparison.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Heroic modernist paintings would enliven the space, alongside
                  the monumental non-Western works that also played well in the
                  hall’s enormous confines. A photograph of the
                  <em>Recent Acquisitions</em> show mounted around the time
                  Sweeney was planning <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> shows the
                  combination of heroic modernist painting (hung from the
                  ceiling by wire!) conversing with recently acquired
                  large-scale Oceanic and African works (fig. 8). Each sculpture
                  was given its own substantial space in the van der Rohe
                  interior. Text was minimized, and each monumental artwork was
                  left to speak for itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is the same basic museological approach seen in
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> (see figure 4). We will let the
                  exhibition photograph guide us to an understanding of the
                  basic characteristics of Sweeney’s display strategies: 1) The
                  great plastic sculptural statements of the Olmec are placed on
                  pedestals and plinths; 2) Each object is isolated from the
                  rest and set away from the wall, enhancing the ability of the
                  viewer to experience the works in all their sculptural
                  fullness; 3) Sweeney used no wall text and kept label text to
                  a minimum. The absence of text was, for Sweeney, a point of
                  pride and a call to use one’s critical visual faculties to
                  make sense of the show. Here, Sweeney reveals his program most
                  clearly: Much like his African sculpture exhibition at MoMA
                  almost three decades earlier (<em>African Negro Art</em>,
                  1935), Sweeney focused exclusively on the formal aspects of
                  the non-Western sculpture and eschewed the cultural history
                  surrounding the pieces in both his curatorial strategies and
                  in the catalog that accompanied the exhibition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  Almost thirty years earlier, each large piece was already put
                  on a plinth and given a significant amount of space, and text
                  was minimized. As MFAH curator Alison Greene has noted about
                  Sweeney’s Cullinan installations, “Sweeney celebrated the
                  vastness of the space” in his most important modernist
                  exhibitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  The same celebration of monumental works in the vastness of
                  Cullinan is no less evident in <em>The Olmec Tradition</em>.
                  Looking at Sweeney’s program through the lens of earlier
                  twentieth-century modernist discourse, we can make more sense
                  of Sweeney’s idiosyncratic essay in the exhibition catalog as
                  well, which also eschews any art historical analysis for a
                  tale of the movement of the colossal head and its resurrection
                  against the Cullinan facade—a monumental work worthy of the
                  monumental architectural statement behind.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Inside, Sweeney deployed the smaller but no less monumental
                  Olmec stone sculptures in dialogue with the grand modernist
                  confines of the hall’s interior, with few textual or other
                  impediments to experiencing this visual dialogue. For Sweeney,
                  the single soaring space of Cullinan Hall supported the most
                  emancipatory and heroic modernist painting and sculpture—as
                  well as monumental non-Western sculpture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The architectural historian Stephen Fox has argued that the
                  construction of Cullinan Hall was a bid for a younger
                  generation of the Houston elite to imprint a new emancipatory
                  modernism on the city.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  In Fox’s view of this architectural statement, Miesian
                  modernism eschewed decoration for more transparent
                  construction. It also traded concealed and closed spaces for
                  vast open spaces. In short, the new generation offered a
                  democratically accessible space compared to the exclusion and
                  intimacy of many older museum spaces, including the earlier
                  MFAH building. One can overplay these dichotomous
                  juxtapositions, but there is little doubt that the architect
                  and his Houston patrons felt that Cullinan’s new sense of
                  space was a transformative move for Houston that the new
                  cosmopolitan director was charged with enlivening.

                  Cullinan Hall had already hosted a museological coup not long
                  before Sweeney’s arrival: the 1959 show of mainly African art
                  entitled <em>Totem Not Taboo</em>. With an innovative display
                  strategy by Jermayne MacAgy (1914–1964), the favored curator
                  of John and Dominique de Menil, this show was the first to
                  show the possibilities of non-Western sculpture in the space,
                  less than a year after it was completed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Particularly prescient in relation to
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> was the use of stark white
                  pedestals to display large-scale sculpture—in this case,
                  largely African sculpture in wood. However, as Greene
                  observed, “MacAgy subtly tamed the scale of Cullinan Hall” by
                  creating paths and well-defined subareas, while Sweeney
                  celebrated the vastness of the space and the monumental
                  qualities of the art inside, as alluded to above.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                <h2>Indigenous American Art</h2>
                <p>
                  In addition to the usefulness of monumental Olmec sculpture to
                  Sweeney’s modernist project of enlivening Cullinan Hall, there
                  were also considerations of cultural diplomacy at work in
                  early 1960s Houston. Sweeney is clearest on his diplomatic
                  motivations for collecting and exhibiting ancient American art
                  in his contribution to <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> catalog.
                  He begins with a list of elements that bind Houston with
                  Mexico, as noted above. He then lays out a program of
                  exhibitions that will follow: an exhibition of colonial-period
                  objects followed by one on contemporary Mexican art. In his
                  larger hypothetical program, then, Sweeney has returned to the
                  traditional nationalist art- historical paradigm that
                  regulated the exhibition of this material from 1940 onward. He
                  was, however, unable to realize either of these exhibitions
                  while in Houston.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After his programmatic statement on a series of Mexico-focused
                  exhibitions, he turns to a dream of his: to show an Olmec
                  colossal head, like the one he could have seen in the
                  traveling Mexican art shows of the late 1950s in Europe, in
                  relation to the modern facade of Cullinan Hall. Sweeney
                  realized this dream with this exhibition, mixing monumental
                  non-Western art and modern architecture. The rest of his
                  catalog contribution focuses on the voyage of an Olmec head
                  from southern Veracruz to Houston for the opening of the show.

                  In his catalog essay, Sweeney recounts the movement of the
                  head to Houston from Veracruz as a colorful narrative, full of
                  drama.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  Here, Sweeney would allow his long-cultivated literary
                  instincts some play. He describes the letters of support from
                  both the president and vice president of the United States as
                  well as his own voyage into the south Veracruz jungle to
                  inspect the colossal head (fig. 9). He includes his meetings
                  with imminent Mexican archaeologists Alfonso Medellín Zenil
                  and Eusebio Dávalos Hurtado and the subsequent construction of
                  a road more than thirty kilometers long in the region of San
                  Lorenzo for the extraction of the colossal head—a road that
                  also provided robbers with an escape after stealing a key
                  object from the San Lorenzo site museum, as Sweeney notes.
                  Other adventures involved helicopter flights to remote
                  villages as well as the heroic efforts needed to get the head
                  to Coatzacoalcos and onto a ship bound for Houston. Sweeney
                  and the trustees also arranged for the movement of the head
                  from Veracruz to Houston to be filmed and made into a short
                  feature. Photographs from the voyage of the head are featured
                  in Sweeney’s catalog essay. In the catalog and on film, the
                  movement of the head was treated as a heroic coup for the
                  museum.
                </p>
                <h2>Sweeney’s Masculinity and Primitive Art</h2>
                <p>
                  One may ask what a veteran modernist museum director was doing
                  traipsing through the jungles of southern Veracruz and
                  personally overseeing the movement of multi-ton ancient
                  monuments. It would have been easier, one could reasonably
                  argue, to simply ask the Mexican authorities to deliver the
                  head to Houston. The spectacle of discovery in the jungle,
                  however, suited Sweeney’s persona and pleased his MFAH
                  supporters. By this point, Sweeney had spent a lifetime
                  cultivating the trope of the muscular, tenacious modernist
                  critic, from his days on the rugby pitch for Jesus College in
                  the University of Cambridge to the description of the inhuman
                  energy he was able to muster in pursuit of his curatorial and
                  writing projects. The director-as-explorer fit this persona
                  well, and the media had a field day with the journey. The
                  attention certainly raised the profile of the museum,
                  especially in Houston but elsewhere in the country as well,
                  which as we have seen was an important goal for the director
                  and trustees. It is indicative of the importance of this event
                  in Sweeney’s life story that more than thirty years later
                  <em>The New York Times</em> gave considerable column space to
                  the travels of the colossal head and its importance to
                  Sweeney’s public profile in his obituary.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sweeney’s cultivation of this persona may be seen as part of
                  his critical rhetoric as well. The art historian Marcia
                  Brennan has parsed Sweeney’s rhetoric for gendered values and
                  found that for Sweeney, good modern art was robustly plastic
                  and coded masculine, while weak modern art was “decorative”
                  and coded feminine. This gendered coding continued in his
                  approach to art outside the Euro-American tradition, where an
                  appreciation for the right formal qualities—the robust
                  three-dimensionality evident in the Olmec sculptural
                  corpus—allowed modern artists access to the intensity of
                  intuitions that they needed to realize advanced modern
                  works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  For Sweeney, then, these non-Western objects (including
                  ancient American objects) were instrumentalized: They helped
                  modernists develop appropriate and productive (male) plastic
                  conceptions. His was a decidedly formalist approach to the
                  emergence of ancient Mesoamerican art at the MFAH, as it had
                  been for African art earlier at MoMA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  Emergence of Sweeney’s Interest in Mesoamerican Art History
                  (1965)
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Sweeney’s deeply formalist approach to curating
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> goes back to his MoMA African art
                  show and his early and important narratives of modernist
                  history. The largely formalist appreciation held for the early
                  Mesoamerican acquisitions as well. There is no record of his
                  sustained interest in the historical context of the Maya
                  panels or other early acquisitions. This situation changes in
                  1965, with the donation of the Hanszen collection of more than
                  two hundred Mesoamerican objects mentioned in the museum’s
                  collecting chronology above. It is in 1965–66 that Sweeney
                  began corresponding with Michael Coe on San Lorenzo Olmec and
                  Gordon Ekholm and Tatiana Proskouriakoff on the meaning and
                  provenience of the Palenque region panel (his first
                  Mesoamerican purchase—see figure 2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Sweeney also commits to a more historical approach in his 1966
                  exhibition <em>Pre-Columbian Art</em>, which used a geographic
                  organizational scheme based on traditional Mesoamerican
                  cultural divisions and chronologies for the 160 pieces
                  displayed, with a catalog essay by Ekholm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the installation of the Hanszen collection exhibition,
                  Sweeney declares in the catalog preface that Houston now stood
                  as one of the premier sites for the appreciation of
                  Mesoamerican, or as he liked to put it, ancient Mexican art,
                  in the United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  The de Menils rewarded these efforts with the donation of a
                  large stone Aztec figure (<a href="https://emuseum.mfah.org/objects/794/standardbearer?ctx=e779d37e79e619d02f89398be951031f31713b40&amp;idx=0" target="_blank">MFAH 66.8</a>) during the same year as the Hanszen exhibition. Not long
                  after this donation, it became clear that Sweeney and the
                  trustees were no longer in accord as to the future of the
                  MFAH, and Sweeney stepped down from the directorship in the
                  following year.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The transformation of ancient American collecting and
                  exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, under James
                  Johnson Sweeney was swift and dramatic. The museum went from a
                  place practically devoid of ancient American objects to one
                  which had a wide collection of Mesoamerican objects, with a
                  number of works of international significance. The museum also
                  mounted one of the earliest focused investigations of Olmec
                  art as a major sculptural tradition in its own right. It is
                  likely that the impetus for this transformation was not driven
                  solely or even mainly by the desire to develop excellent
                  collections in this area but instead served institutional
                  desires far beyond Mesoamerican art history. The focus on
                  ancient American art, while new to Sweeney, was originally
                  part of a larger plan of cultural diplomacy between Texas and
                  Mexico. Furthermore, Sweeney saw the development of
                  Mesoamerican collections and especially
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> as a way to highlight the grand
                  exhibition space of Cullinan Hall and activate its exterior.
                  The monumental stone Olmec sculptures worked very well in the
                  hall, as Sweeney knew they would. The spectacular movement of
                  San Lorenzo Monument 2 (the colossal head) through the jungles
                  of southern Veracruz and the waters of the Gulf Coast to the
                  front of Cullinan Hall’s glass and steel facade created a
                  heroic narrative that served to boost the museum’s regional
                  and national profile.

                  Studying the rise of pre-Columbian collecting and exhibition
                  in Houston through James Johnson Sweeney’s tenure as the
                  director at the MFAH is an exercise in placing ancient
                  American art amid “the chaos and energy of cultural
                  production” of a museum on the move in the early 1960s. The
                  social lives of these ancient American objects may be seen to
                  take on more breadth as they are allowed to circulate in other
                  conversations, some well outside ancient American art history.
                  Such narratives help illuminate the myriad aesthetic and
                  social forces that ran through these conversations that
                  eventually created the US collections discussed in this
                  volume.
