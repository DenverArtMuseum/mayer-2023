      “The art of those who lived here before the white man came” | Collecting
      the “Other Americas”
    </title>

    <meta name="description" content="The term *pre-Columbian art* once described the material culture produced in the Americas, mostly south of the US-Mexico border, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Museums across the United States now refer to these departments as art of *the Americas* or *the ancient Americas*. Stewards of these collections in American art museums have begun confronting the changing meanings and import of what Nelson Rockefeller once described as the “other Americas.” This symposium volume captures the history of collecting and display of ancient American works in art museums, a history surprisingly poorly documented until now.">

                <p>
                  In 1920, four years after the Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA)
                  opened, its Board of Trustees resolved that it would display
                  “the art of primitive Americans, such as Peruvian, Mexican,
                  and North American Indian . . . which would be the first
                  attempt of an American museum to show in a constructive way
                  [that is, not as archaeological artifact] the art of those who
                  lived here before the white man came.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  The impetus for the resolution, unrealized until 1926,
                  probably stems in part from the background of its author,
                  Frederic A. Whiting (1873–1959), the museum’s first director
                  (fig. 1). Prior to his arrival in Cleveland, he had been
                  deeply involved in the Arts and Crafts movement in New
                  England, serving as secretary of Boston’s nationally
                  influential Society of Arts and Crafts for a dozen years,
                  among other things.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  The Arts and Crafts movement embraced handcraftsmanship and
                  precapitalist forms of society, such as those of the
                  aboriginal Americas, as antidotes to the impacts of
                  industrialization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  In line with these ideas, Whiting and at least some trustees
                  conceived of the museum’s collection above all else as an
                  educational resource for the immigrants who worked in the
                  industries that were a source of Cleveland’s
                  early-twentieth-century wealth.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is a measure of Whiting’s ambition in the field that in the
                  1920s he considered acquiring two ancient Andean collections,
                  one valued at a respectable $29,000 (today, over
                  $500,000).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  That acquisition had been recommended by Philip Ainsworth
                  Means (1892–1944), an Andean specialist and one of the many
                  archaeologists with whom the CMA would eventually consult
                  about authenticity and related matters. Neither purchase came
                  to fruition, however, and during the first few decades, the
                  collection consisted almost entirely of modest gifts from the
                  city’s prosperous citizens, among them the first of several
                  women who played strong roles in the formation of the museum’s
                  Indigenous American holdings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, Whiting’s greatest contribution to the field was not
                  building the collection but rather advocating for Indigenous
                  arts as worthy of an art museum’s attention. In 1929, in one
                  of his last acts before resigning, he named the art historian
                  and artist Charles F. Ramus (1902–1979) “In Charge of
                  Primitive Art,” a designation that bundled together and
                  singled out Indigenous American, African, and Oceanic arts
                  while falling short of a curatorial appointment. In doing so,
                  he was likely encouraged by Mary Gardiner Ford (d. 1959), a
                  museum supporter who in the same year created a fund dedicated
                  to the acquisition of primitive art, especially from the
                  ancient Americas, in memory of her late husband.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                  During Ramus’s brief employment (he resigned in early 1935),
                  he made the museum’s first nontextile ancient American
                  purchases—three bowls winnowed from a large group of Andean
                  (Nazca) ceramics offered by the Argentine dealer Mauro Enrique
                  Pando y Pomar.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  He also organized several temporary installations of primitive
                  art for both the general public and children, the latter
                  because, like some other early curators, he divided his time
                  with the Department of Educational Works (fig. 2). His efforts
                  in this vein included what may have been the museum’s first
                  ancient American exhibition based on loans,
                  <em>Comparative Pottery and Peruvian Textiles</em>, in
                  1931.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  It is worth noting here that in the early years, educators
                  played a strong role in promoting primitive arts in Cleveland,
                  especially after the hire of Thomas Munro (1897–1974), an
                  internationally noted aesthetic philosopher, as Curator of
                  Education in 1931.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  From the start, the department had its own funds to purchase
                  objects for use in public outreach programs, and the education
                  art collection, which includes Indigenous American arts,
                  eventually grew to be substantial.

                  In 1930, after Whiting’s departure, the trustees promoted
                  William M. Milliken (1889–1978), who had been hired as the
                  museum’s first decorative arts curator in 1919, to become its
                  second director (fig. 3). Like Whiting, Milliken had no formal
                  arts training, though he took art history courses during his
                  studies at Princeton University. It was through his experience
                  in museums—first on the curatorial staff of The Metropolitan
                  Museum of Art, where he worked with J. Pierpont Morgan’s
                  medieval collection, and then in Cleveland—that he developed
                  interests in the medieval and the French Gothic and Baroque
                  periods, distinguishing himself in acquisitions through his
                  taste for small, finely wrought objects made of precious
                  materials.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  During his directorship, he continued in his curatorial role,
                  apparently assuming responsibility for primitive arts after
                  Ramus departed. Though the Great Depression withered the
                  museum’s budget throughout the 1930s, Milliken went on in the
                  1940s and 1950s to amass the core of the CMA’s ancient
                  American collection. Crucially, he did not do so alone but
                  rather with the collaboration of an important trustee, Emery
                  May Holden Norweb (1895–1984), and the help of an ambitious
                  art dealer, John Wise (1901–1981).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                  Norweb was a member of Cleveland’s economic and social
                  aristocracy whose family, the Holdens, had been involved in
                  the museum as trustees from its inception (fig. 4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Following suit, she joined the Advisory Council in 1940 and
                  soon became a member of the board, serving as its sixth
                  president during the 1960s—the first of only two female board
                  leaders so far. She was undoubtedly aided in her
                  accomplishments on the board not only by her family ties but
                  also by her long experience as the wife of a diplomat, R.
                  Henry Norweb, who served in posts primarily in Latin America,
                  including ambassadorships in Peru and Cuba and lesser
                  positions in Mexico, Bolivia, and elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  It was in Chile, in 1930, that she recalled having started to
                  collect in the field, saying that her eyes “were opened to
                  pre-Columbian art, and people who were experts in the field
                  began to bring me things. It was a gorgeous opportunity
                  because no one was buying it then.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  The unnamed experts may have been some of the archaeologists
                  who, like Means, routinely conferred with collectors,
                  curators, and dealers at the time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Ten years later, in 1940, she began to make a series of gifts
                  that transformed the CMA’s collection and helped open the
                  ancient Americas as a collecting area.

                  The Norweb Collection of ancient American art comprises about
                  seventy objects, most from the Andes, a focus that continued
                  early interest in the region.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Among her gifts are a group of South Coast textiles that
                  remain anchors of the collection, including the magnificent
                  lower half of an early Nasca mantle regarded as the greatest
                  painted cloth to have survived from the region (fig. 5). These
                  textiles seem to have helped to convince the young director
                  that ancient American arts, which he had disparaged as
                  archaeological, possessed artistic merit.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  She also donated or contributed funds to purchase key objects
                  from Mesoamerica and the Isthmian region (fig. 6). It may be
                  that she acquired some of the works in her collection while
                  living in Latin America, though there seem to be no records
                  identifying them; she also purchased material in the United

                  One of her US sources was John Wise, the Virginia-born,
                  Harvard-educated, New York–based stockbroker, who, having been
                  financially ruined in the crash of 1929, began selling family
                  heirlooms (fig. 7). He went on to become a major ancient
                  American arts dealer—the king of midcentury East Coast
                  dealers, in the words of Michael Coe, a contemporary and Yale
                  University anthropologist and curator.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  It seems that neither Milliken nor Norweb were acquainted with
                  Wise when, in 1939, he visited Cleveland and offered the
                  museum an Isthmian gold pendant that Milliken found
                  “extraordinary” (fig. 8). Lacking funds, Milliken contacted
                  Norweb, who agreed to purchase it for the museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Years later, Wise recalled this as his first sale of an
                  ancient American object to a museum dedicated to art and a
                  turning point in the appreciation of ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  The encounter seems to have begun a long friendship between
                  Milliken and Wise that Coe singles out for mention and is
                  discernible in the warm, joking correspondence preserved in
                  Milliken’s papers (fig. 9).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  During the period of Milliken’s stewardship, Wise was by far
                  the most common source of ancient American objects that
                  entered the collection, whether by direct purchases or as
                  gifts from donors or Wise himself.

                <p>
                  In addition to Norweb, Helen Humphreys was the most notable
                  member of the ancient American collecting community centered
                  on Milliken and the museum. A Spanish teacher in Cleveland’s
                  public school system, she wished to create a memorial to her
                  late parents and originally considered focusing her attention
                  on objects of peninsular Spanish origin to do so. But she
                  turned instead to the ancient arts of the Spanish colonies,
                  one suspects with Milliken’s encouragement, and over two
                  decades donated forty-six works, about half of them Isthmian
                  gold ornaments but also others (fig. 10).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  Milliken thought that her donations came from her teacher’s
                  salary, but she may have had family money: In one five-year
                  period in the 1940s, her cash contributions for acquisitions
                  totaled at least $43,500 (well over $700,000 today). As this
                  implies, she regularly gave funds to the museum and allowed
                  Milliken to negotiate and finalize purchases on her behalf,
                  but she also bought directly—in both cases, usually from Wise,
                  when the source is recorded.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Her process for selecting objects is not known, but Milliken’s
                  guiding hand may be betrayed by her collection’s emphasis on
                  small-scale objects made of precious materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Aside from Norweb, several other trustees, two of them also
                  women, supported ancient American acquisitions during
                  Milliken’s years, though more episodically: Jane Taft Ingalls
                  (1874–1962), niece of William Howard Taft; Roberta Holden Bole
                  (1876–1950), Norweb’s aunt; and Leonard C. Hanna Jr.
                  (1889–1957), heir to a Great Lakes industrial fortune and by
                  far the museum’s most important donor. His collecting focused
                  on European art, but he was interested in the ancient Americas
                  and is said to have spent many hours in Wise’s gallery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Apart from acquisitions, Wise was also very involved with
                  <em>Art of the Americas,</em> an important exhibition,
                  discussed below, that Milliken organized in the mid-1940s.
                  Wise’s contributions included lending objects and donating
                  funds for an exhibition publication. Perhaps most notable from
                  today’s perspective, however, is the fact that he also stepped
                  in when, three months before the show opened, one of
                  Milliken’s brothers died suddenly, and Milliken, describing
                  himself as stunned and desolated, went to Wyoming for two
                  months of rest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  In letters to lenders, he deputized Wise as his representative
                  in loan affairs—not Helen Foote, a junior decorative arts
                  curator who assisted Milliken on the project—and Wise seems to
                  have visited museums and negotiated loans on Milliken’s
                  behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There can be no doubt that Wise was a businessman whose
                  activities were calculated to advance his commercial
                  interests. But Coe, who knew him well and advises caution in
                  judging activities that occurred in a climate radically
                  different from today’s, describes Wise as a benefactor and
                  good friend when it came to the CMA and Milliken.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  Wise’s motivations for being so may be revealed in a
                  conversation he had in 1945 with Natacha Rambova, an American
                  Hollywood costume and set designer interested in tracing
                  designs that appear in art across cultures. She related the
                  conversation in a letter to Milliken, writing that Wise “feels
                  about that Museum as you do. In a way he feels it is also his
                  baby and would do anything he can to help your pre-Columbian
                  wing. Apparently, he has been fighting for this early American
                  art for years and seems to want to leave something worthwhile,
                  to feel he has been able to accomplish something of real
                  value.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Milliken left no explanation of his own reasons for pursuing
                  the ancient Americas so avidly except to say that it was a
                  matter of opportunity following a lucky coincidence—the
                  meeting that involved the Isthmian pendant (see figure 8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  His report of his first encounter with Norweb’s Andean
                  textiles, during which he described himself as “breathless”
                  and “transfixed,” suggests that, at least at the beginning,
                  the area may have been one of the intense enthusiasms for
                  which he was known, this one reinforced by Norweb’s and Wise’s
                  mutual interest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In CMA publications, Milliken’s effort with the ancient
                  American collection is usually said to be among his greatest
                  achievements—and one he shared with Norweb.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  They were abetted by the other donors discussed here and
                  probably also by wartime disruption of European and Asian
                  markets, competitive pricing of ancient American arts compared
                  to those of many other places and periods, and interest in
                  Pan-Americanism that was widespread at the time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  When Milliken retired in 1958, he left the museum’s Andean
                  holdings about twice as strong numerically as those from
                  either of the other two regions, though the collection is also
                  said to have been noted for its Isthmian gold, thanks in part
                  to Humphreys.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Besides textiles, holdings were also strongly focused on the
                  small, precious, three-dimensional objects that were
                  Milliken’s predilection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  <em>Art of the Americas</em> Exhibition (November 9,
                  1945–January 6, 1946)
                </h2>
                <p>
                  As noted above, in 1945, with Helen Foote’s and Wise’s help,
                  Milliken organized <em>Art of the Americas</em>, which,
                  strikingly, was one of the few largish exhibitions the museum
                  staged in the postwar period.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  His intention for the show seems to have been, in part, to
                  celebrate new acquisitions, which, in his opinion, had boosted
                  CMA’s ancient American collection into the first rank. Above
                  all, however, was his nationally noteworthy ambition to prove
                  that the “art of the Western Hemisphere can stand on its own
                  feet.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  It follows that the exhibition made no pretense of being
                  comprehensive, instead embracing quality and beauty as the
                  sole criteria for object selection—borrowing a phrase from
                  Milliken, an <em>ARTnews</em> review valorized the “strange
                  beauty” of ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  The result was an unsystematic sampling of all three ancient
                  culture areas that brought together works from twenty-seven
                  institutions, private collectors, and dealers around a core of
                  CMA objects. The show, which is documented in a series of
                  black-and-white photos, was laid out in geographic clusters in
                  two galleries, with Andean textiles ranged along the walls to
                  encircle large cases containing objects of clay, metal, and
                  other media.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Certain design features seem to have advanced Milliken’s goal
                  for the show. For instance, cases were divided internally by
                  panels in an arrangement that, according to <em>ARTnews</em>,
                  showed each object in its “most felicitous aspect”—in other
                  words, as a work of art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Also, other three-dimensional objects were placed individually
                  on pedestals against the walls, perhaps to emphasize their
                  sculptural qualities and silhouettes, in addition to calling
                  them to visitors’ attention. Finally, though the old
                  installation photos are grainy and often difficult to
                  decipher, texts and other interpretive materials seem to have
                  been minimal, as though to reduce distractions that would
                  compete with the artworks.

                  In the <em>Bulletin</em> and many letters to lenders and
                  donors, Milliken exulted that the show was “one of the most
                  successful and popular” in the museum’s history and that it
                  drew enthusiastic, appreciative visitors from both the East
                  and West Coasts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  One was M. D. C. Crawford, a self-taught expert and champion
                  of ancient Andean textiles, consultant to major museums, and
                  trustee of the Textile Museum in Washington, DC, among other
                  things. His reaction appears to have been representative: “I
                  think it is, barring none, the finest exhibition of its kind
                  for choice and presentation I have ever seen.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Local response was no less rapt; for instance, after seeing
                  the show, N. R. Howard, editor of the
                  <em>Cleveland News,</em> wrote to a board member, “That durn
                  show moved me more than anything I have seen for a long
                  time.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  Perhaps due to this reception, after the show closed the
                  museum invested an amount of money that today is
                  surprising—$5,300 (now, over $70,000)—in a small,
                  fifty-eight-page booklet to create a pictorial record of the
                  effort (fig. 11).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>

                  The Monuments Men: Sherman Lee and Henry Hawley (1958–89)
                </h2>
                <p>
                  When Milliken departed, Sherman E. Lee (1918–2008) soon
                  succeeded him to become the institution’s third director.
                  Familiar with the museum through his service as Curator of
                  Oriental Art since 1952, he lost no time in expressing his
                  “strong feeling” that the ancient American collection required
                  “larger sculptures and . . . other items . . . not already
                  represented in the collection.” He made this stipulation in a
                  letter to Wise that accompanied the return of three dozen
                  small objects that apparently had been at the museum for
                  Milliken’s consideration.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Also, an analysis revealed that the decorative arts had
                  received the lion’s share of acquisition funds since the
                  museum’s founding, while Western paintings languished. Thus,
                  Lee and the trustees, soon to be led by Norweb, agreed in the
                  future to devote no more than 15 percent of the budget to the
                  decorative arts, including ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  Another decision, unspoken in memos but clear in acquisition
                  records, was to diversify the sources from whom material was
                  purchased. Supplanted by a variety of other sellers, Wise
                  placed only a few more works with the museum before he died in
                  1981.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>

                  Despite constraints, a number of the collection’s most iconic
                  works were purchased over the next decade under the guidance
                  of Henry H. Hawley (d. 2019), another European decorative arts
                  specialist who assumed responsibility for the Indigenous
                  Americas when he was hired in 1960 (fig. 12). He arrived at
                  the CMA fresh from the University of Delaware Winterthur
                  Program, where he wrote a master’s thesis about Euro-American
                  decorative arts. No doubt responding to Lee’s imperatives
                  about collection development, with which he may have agreed,
                  in the 1960s, Hawley bought four of the museum’s largest
                  ancient American objects (excluding textiles), most obviously
                  the nine-foot-tall front face of a Maya stela, together with
                  several smaller works (figs. 13 and 14). All but a few are
                  from Mesoamerica, perhaps due in part to an interest in
                  correcting the collection’s Andean tilt. Also, the
                  Mesoamerican art market more frequently offered the
                  large-scale works that were of interest at the time, a decade
                  during which the illicit removal of monumental and
                  architectural art from Mexico and Guatemala reached a
                  crescendo.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  Aesthetically, Hawley leaned toward the region’s realistic
                  styles, especially Maya.

                  During the 1970s, Hawley remained in charge of the ancient
                  American collection, purchasing a few more of its best-known
                  works. Except for a handful of gifts, however, acquisitions
                  stopped after 1973 due to increasing sensitivities about
                  collecting that culminated in the 1970 UNESCO convention on
                  cultural property and its guidelines for diminishing the
                  illegal traffic in antiquities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  By the early 1980s, Hawley seems to have transferred care of
                  the ancient Americas to Virginia Crawford, an assistant
                  decorative arts curator. During his stewardship, he presided
                  over a dramatic decline in acquisitions caused by the shifting
                  milieu and a thinning of the ranks of the group of donors who
                  had clustered around Milliken. But Hawley’s contributions,
                  characterized by their great beauty and refinement, had a
                  considerable impact on the collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the next sixteen years, the museum purchased only one
                  ancient American object, an Aztec gold warrior figurine (<a href="https://www.clevelandart.org/art/collection/search?search=aztec+warrior+figurine" target="_blank">1984.37</a>), during the directorship of Evan H. Turner, Lee’s
                  successor. A modernist and self-described “paintings man”
                  whose interests lay outside the Americas, Turner nevertheless
                  seems to have masterminded the CMA’s 1986 participation in an
                  important ancient American exhibition organized by the Kimbell
                  Art Museum:
                  <em>The Blood of Kings: A New Interpretation of Maya Art</em>,
                  one of the CMA’s most successful exhibitions of the decade and
                  one that gave rise to a local community of Maya
                  enthusiasts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  Its popularity may have encouraged Turner to undertake the
                  museum’s first attempt to recruit a curator trained in the
                  ancient American specialty when Crawford, who shepherded the
                  exhibition through its Cleveland appearance, resigned her

                  Margaret Young-Sánchez arrived in 1989, as she was finishing a
                  doctoral dissertation about Andean textiles in Columbia
                  University’s art history program. Apparently coincidentally,
                  the following year saw the arrival of the largest gift in the
                  collection’s history—149 objects from the estate of James and
                  Florence Gruener (1903–1990; 1908–1982), long-time
                  Clevelanders and museum supporters who had retired to
                  California. During the 1930s, the Grueners began to travel
                  widely in Mexico, where they became fascinated by folk and
                  ancient art traditions alike. Her attraction appears to have
                  been aesthetic while his interest was in the perceived
                  similarities among the religions of Native America and other
                  parts of the world, and he eventually self-published a book on
                  the topic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>

                  Once Young-Sánchez had processed and organized an exhibition
                  of the bequest, she embarked on a very active acquisition
                  campaign during the brief directorship of medievalist Robert
                  Bergman (1993–99).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Concerned more with quality than with filling gaps or
                  balancing regional representation, she collected with a
                  relatively even hand across the three ancient culture areas,
                  buying to both strengths, especially the Maya collection, and
                  weaknesses, including Isthmian region ceramics, as objects of
                  high caliber became available (figs. 16 and 17).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  A notable exception to her collecting practice was Andean
                  textile holdings, which had been static since Norweb’s
                  foundational gifts of the 1940s and remained so in the 1990s
                  due to the textile curator’s interest in other traditions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  A few patterns established during Hawley’s tenure continued.
                  First, acquisitions came from a range of dealers. Also, apart
                  from the Gruener bequest, few other gifts arrived, the most
                  significant of which was from Clara Taplin Rankin, a veteran
                  of the Milliken era, long-time trustee, and supporter of the
                  ancient Americas. Frances (Franny) Prindle Taft (1921–2017)
                  also contributed to building the collection via her
                  decades-long trusteeship rather than donations.

                <p>
                  Records of Young-Sánchez’s activity during the decade—not only
                  acquisitions but also publications, reinstallation, and
                  exhibitions (both realized and proposed)—create the impression
                  of a determined effort to amplify the voice of the Americas
                  within the museum after a long period of relative quiescence
                  and to improve national awareness of the collection, which she
                  described as “one of the finest in the US.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  She had been hired as an assistant curator of decorative arts.
                  Before resigning in 1999, she had succeeded in establishing a
                  department independent of the decorative arts that included
                  not only the arts of the Americas but also the arts of Africa
                  and Oceania, which had been part of her portfolio.

                  The next director—the deeply sympathetic Katharine Lee Reid
                  (1941–2022), daughter of Sherman Lee—created separate
                  curatorships for Indigenous American and African arts under
                  the sensible rationale that the areas have little to do with
                  each other.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  In 2000, I assumed the Americas position, also shortly after
                  completing a doctoral thesis about Andean textiles at Columbia
                  University, and served in it for over two decades. I will
                  leave to a future curator the task of summarizing my
                  collection development activities except to say that, as in
                  the museum’s early days, efforts focused most strongly on
                  Andean arts, including textiles, now in an attempt to put them
                  on more equal footing with the Mesoamerican holdings that had
                  come to dominate the collection (fig. 18). I did so in the
                  belief that, when possible, fine objects with pre-1970
                  provenance should be safeguarded and made available for study
                  in museums while collecting standards, relationships with
                  source countries, and guidelines for repatriation continue to
                  evolve. A major loan exhibition that I organized,
                  <em>Wari: Lords of the Ancient Andes</em> (2010), also
                  concerned the central Andes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my tenure, another full-circle moment occurred in 2022,
                  when the museum adopted an “Indigenous Peoples and Land
                  Acknowledgment” that, without explicitly intending to do so,
                  renewed the museum’s 1920 resolution to foster appreciation of
                  Indigenous American arts and the alternative ways of thought
                  they embody.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  Importantly, the acknowledgment also updated the early
                  resolution by orienting attention as much toward people as
                  toward art, especially building collaborative relationships
                  with Indigenous artists and communities. In this spirit, I
                  wrote the acknowledgment, my last official act, following the
                  directions of a committee of local Native North American
                  advisors, some of whom belong to historic Ohio tribes, such as
                  the Haudenosaunee, who were driven from the state after the
                  1830 passage of the Indian Removal Act. The families of
                  others, including members of Pueblo and Lakota nations, had
                  moved to Cleveland under the auspices of the federal urban
                  relocation programs in the 1950s through the 1970s. Since the
                  acknowledgment was adopted, and in contrast to a decades-long
                  pattern of neglecting Indigenous North American arts, the CMA
                  has added several contemporary works to its collection—the
                  first was
                  <a href="https://www.clevelandart.org/art/2022.98" target="_blank"><em>Survival</em></a>, a suite of color lithographs by the Salish, Shoshone, and
                  Métis artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  It remains to be seen whether this refreshed and reoriented
                  commitment will transform into an acquisition program that
                  bypasses the world of the archaeological past to focus on the
                  realm of the living and the present throughout the Indigenous
                  Americas.
                </p>
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                  The Cleveland Museum of Art’s ancient American collection is
                  the result of early aspirations concerning the Indigenous
                  Americas that did not begin to be realized until the
                  mid-twentieth century. Efforts often reflected preoccupations
                  not unique to Cleveland.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  Most centrally, from the outset, CMA directors and curators
                  joined a broader, well-known struggle to improve these arts’
                  respectability and appeal to Euro-American audiences,
                  including academics whose interest would promote further
                  study. They did so through attempts to validate the material
                  as art rather than archaeological artifact. This endeavor was
                  among the many factors that led to a livelier interest and
                  market in ancient American arts, which, in turn, fed
                  midcentury collecting peaks in Cleveland and elsewhere. In the
                  1970s, ancient American collecting declined at the CMA, as it
                  did at other institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast to some other museums, Cleveland’s collection is
                  largely the result not of gifts, with obvious exceptions, but
                  rather of purchases that were matters of curatorial
                  discretion. In terms of its sources, the collection may be
                  unusual in its midcentury dependence on a single dealer and
                  the friendship to which that dependence owed. It also may be
                  unusual in the involvement of so many women in its formation,
                  Norweb first among them but also Bole, Ford, Humphreys,
                  Ingalls, Rankin, Taft, and others. The motivations for their
                  engagement with ancient American arts are not recorded but may
                  have had to do, in part, with affordability, as Norweb once
                  implied. Their interest could also have had roots in the
                  Euro-American tendency to affiliate women, as well as the
                  racialized Other, with material that the West pejoratively
                  classified as decorative arts, or crafts, including the
                  elaborate ceramics, textiles, and personal ornaments of the
                  Americas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  It is hoped that the present volume, the first of its kind,
                  will shed more light on these and other factors that have
                  shaped US museum collections over the last century.

                  Museum’s collection is likewise limited, but holdings seem to
                  comprise about one hundred ancient Andean objects, one-third
                  of them acquired in an early purchase, in 1883, and the rest
                  by subsequent gifts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  Most of the 150 ceramic works at the Columbus Museum of Art
                  represent Mesoamerican styles, especially west Mexican, some
                  purchased in the 1980s and earlier; among several gifts are
                  fifty works from the collection of Eva Glimcher, cofounder
                  with her son, Arne, of New York’s Pace Gallery. The styles of
                  the seventy objects at Oberlin College’s Allen Memorial Art
                  Museum range from Mexican to Peruvian; half, including many
                  fragments, belong to a study collection. The Toledo Museum of
                  Art’s principal ancient American holdings are some eighty
                  ceramic vessels from Panama’s Chiriquí region; the majority
                  were donated in 1907 and come from Yale University’s Peabody
                  Museum, which deaccessioned them as duplicates, a common early
                  practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>

                        Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology,
                        agreed to have Peabody staff survey Norweb property on

                        In retirement, Milliken remained in touch with Wise (see
                        figure 9) and wrote the foreword to the catalog for an
                        exhibition, <em>World of Ancient Gold</em>, that Wise
                        organized at the New York World’s Fair in 1964–65. Wise
                        bequeathed his collection and papers to the Dallas
                        Museum of Art. According to the late, long-time Dallas
                        curator Carol Robbins, however, the Wises had always
                        anticipated that their collection would find a home in
                        Cleveland (personal communication with the author, June
                        12, 2007). The shifting wind that followed Milliken’s
                        retirement in Cleveland likely explains their change of
                        mind, at least in part.

                        In the mid-1950s, during Sherman Lee’s directorship,
                        scores of Native North American objects in the permanent
                        collection were transferred to the education art
                        collection, over Henry Hawley’s objections. Memo from
                        Hawley to Gabriel Weisburg, October 1974, ancient
                        Americas departmental files. That trend was reversed in
                        the 2000s; also, Young-Sánchez acquired several North
                        American objects in the 1990s.

                        This estimate comes from an unillustrated spreadsheet
