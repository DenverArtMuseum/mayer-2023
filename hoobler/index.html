      Dealers, Donors, and Directors | Collecting the “Other Americas”
    </title>

    <meta name="description" content="The term *pre-Columbian art* once described the material culture produced in the Americas, mostly south of the US-Mexico border, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Museums across the United States now refer to these departments as art of *the Americas* or *the ancient Americas*. Stewards of these collections in American art museums have begun confronting the changing meanings and import of what Nelson Rockefeller once described as the “other Americas.” This symposium volume captures the history of collecting and display of ancient American works in art museums, a history surprisingly poorly documented until now.">

                  In the present day, nearly every curator of ancient American
                  art in a US art museum has a strategic plan for their
                  exhibitions, for acquisitions, and perhaps for programming and
                  artist collaborations. Thoughtful collecting, display, and
                  interpretation, directed by curatorial staff knowledgeable
                  about their subject area, are hallmarks of twenty-first
                  century museums. But things were quite different just a few
                  decades ago. Many museums in the Mid-Atlantic region, like
                  their New York and Boston counterparts, began to be formed in
                  the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, a time when
                  both curatorial training and study of the ancient Americas
                  were in their infancy. This essay will show how collections at
                  the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore Museum of Art, and
                  Philadelphia Museum of Art were shaped, not by curatorial
                  concerns and strategy but by the actions of dealers, donors,
                  and directors. Even as the study and knowledge of the ancient
                  Americas expanded, few museums have had the luxury of
                  full-time, permanent curators trained in this area. Of the
                  institutions mentioned here, only the Walters has engaged a
                  full-time, permanent curator for its collection (the author of
                  this essay) and only in 2017. So, for decades, it was dealers,
                  donors, directors, as well as fellows, conservators,
                  registrars, and administrators who stepped in to help form,
                  expand, and interpret collections and to organize exhibitions
                  featuring art of the ancient Americas. Although this essay
                  discusses museums of the Mid-Atlantic region, the pattern of
                  other-than-curatorial administration can be extrapolated to a
                  range of other museums that could not be covered by the 2023
                  Mayer Center symposium and this volume.

                  The influential dealer George Kunz (1856–1932) encouraged
                  Henry Walters (1848–1951), the founder of the Walters Art
                  Museum, to buy a range of works from Tiffany &amp; Co., where
                  Kunz was the first gemologist.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  While not a typical dealer with his own gallery, Kunz worked
                  in various facets of Tiffany’s business for decades, but his
                  role in marketing works of the ancient Americas, to Walters
                  and other collectors, is still little-known. Kunz is
                  recognized in this field only in connection with a jadeite
                  figure held by the American Museum of Natural History in New
                  York. One of the first works to be identified on a stylistic
                  basis as Olmec, it is still known as the

                <p>
                  Born in New York, Kunz became very interested in stones from a
                  young age, after a formative visit to the mineral specimens at
                  the Broadway Barnum Museum (fig. 1). Shortly after, he moved
                  with his family to Hoboken, New Jersey, and began forming
                  collections of the many rock types he was able to acquire
                  there. He eventually sold a collection of minerals to the
                  University of Minnesota, which gave him the confidence, at
                  just twenty years of age, to offer a tourmaline for sale to
                  Charles Louis Tiffany of Tiffany &amp; Co. jewelers. At that
                  time, only diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, along
                  with pearls, were typically used for jewelry. Kunz encouraged
                  Tiffany to market a broader range of gemstones to a growing
                  middle class. Tiffany hired him in 1876, and three years
                  later, at just twenty-three years old, he became the company’s
                  youngest vice president.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                  Morgan and the Walters family of Baltimore. The founding
                  patriarch was William Thompson Walters (1820–1894), but Kunz
                  was especially close to William’s son Henry (1848–1931) (fig.
                  2). The family amassed great fortunes in a number of
                  industries, particularly railroads. As Confederate
                  sympathizers, though, they left Baltimore during the Civil War
                  and lived in France where Henry was exposed to art from a
                  young age. Over his adult life, he would make enormous
                  additions to the modest collection begun by his father.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>

                <p>
                  It is not known how the paths of Henry Walters and George Kunz
                  first intersected, but they certainly would have met by the
                  time that Walters attended the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair,
                  where he purchased items including at least one vase and a
                  ring from Tiffany.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  As a plum marketing opportunity, it’s likely that Kunz would
                  have also been present at the firm’s pavilion there. And Henry
                  was not only a wealthy Baltimorean but maintained a residence
                  in New York and served on the Executive Committee of The
                  Metropolitan Museum of Art beginning in 1903, becoming a
                  second vice president there in 1913, a position he would hold
                  until his death in 1931.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                  While Henry Walters’s extensive patronage of Tiffany &amp; Co.
                  has been documented, less well known is that Walters also
                  bought about 120 works of ancient American art from Tiffany,
                  likely through Kunz’s efforts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Unfortunately, none are as large or unusual as the Kunz axe,
                  but the mere fact that Walters was purchasing such works for
                  his own art collection was unusual for the time. Most of his
                  acquisitions were jades or gold works from Colombia or Central
                  America, objects that the gemologist acquired in his travels
                  in search of new semiprecious stones to be marketed to US
                  audiences. Kunz wrote about Colombian gold in an 1887 article
                  for <em>American Antiquarian</em> magazine, at least a decade
                  before Walters bought some of his first ancient American
                  works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Walters’s first invoice from Tiffany for an ancient American
                  work dates to October 1897, for a single silver “Peruvian
                  chalice,” almost certainly
                  <a href="https://art.thewalters.org/detail/14246/ceremonial-cup-with-faces-and-a-stylized-snake/" target="_blank">WAM 57.977</a>, followed by six Colombian gold works in November (figs. 3
                  and 4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  After his 1897 purchases, Walters’s collecting slowed down,
                  but in late 1910, he purchased from Tiffany five jadeite
                  pendants from Central America and sixty-seven gold ornaments,
                  which were shipped to his Baltimore home along with European
                  <em>objets d’art</em> and gems.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  A letter of late 1910 from Tiffany clarified that these gold
                  works were from the Chiriquí region of Panama, on the Costa
                  Rican border.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  In late 1911, Walters purchased an additional twenty-eight
                  gold works, said to be from Colombia.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kunz and Tiffany’s connection to this material is important in
                  part because, although many museums are known to have Chiriquí
                  gold objects acquired around this time—the Museum of Fine
                  Arts, Boston, National Museum of Natural History, Heye
                  Foundation, Harvard’s Peabody Museum, and Yale University Art
                  Museum, as well as several non-US museums—no one has yet
                  traced their histories carefully to determine which of these
                  works may have originated with Kunz.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In that same year, Walters bought two Mexica (Aztec) central
                  Mexican sculptures from the dealer Dikran Kelekian
                  (1868–1951), who had galleries in Paris and New York.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  These are the only known ancient American works handled by
                  Kelekian, but it is likely that he moved to profit from
                  Walters’s interest. William Johnston, Walters’s curator
                  emeritus and biographer of the Walters family, asserts that
                  Walters’s curiosity was piqued by the French
                  <em>Exposition retrospective</em> in the Trocadéro in 1878, at
                  which “early Mexican terra cottas and sculptures captured the
                  public’s imagination and conjured up such concepts as the lost
                  content [<em>sic</em>] of Atlantis and prehistoric connections
                  between Europe and America.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Johnston was probably correct in asserting that Walters’s
                  interest in Central American gold and jades lay largely in
                  their origins and craftsmanship as well as a desire to form a
                  universal survey collection similar to that of The
                  Metropolitan Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  It is notable that during Walters’s term on The Met’s
                  Executive Committee, the museum sent its own ancient American
                  collections on long-term loan to the American Museum of
                  Natural History, issuing a message that such works were not
                  part of the “art” canon, as Joanne Pillsbury has noted.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Yet, the two central Mexican stone statues purchased by Henry
                  Walters, and to a lesser extent the golden works from Tiffany,
                  continued to reverberate over the decades. The two stone works
                  depict a rattlesnake knotted into a ball (fig. 5) and a seated
                  figure with a tall, feathered headdress, likely the deity
                  Macuilxochitl. Both had been part of the storied Pingret
                  collection of ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Both were also included in Pál Kelemen’s
                  <em>Medieval American Art</em> (originally published 1943), a
                  key source when there were few published resources,
                  particularly in English, available for scholars.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>

                  The basalt rattlesnake became one of the museum’s most popular
                  objects. It was shown with gold works in the 1953 Walters
                  exhibition, <em>4000 Years of Modern Art</em>, which was
                  linked to the Museum of Modern Art exhibition,
                  <em>Timeless Aspects of Modern Art</em>. It was part of a
                  teaching portfolio of images chosen by curator René
                  d’Harnoncourt, which were said to be related to each other on
                  the basis of “affinity and resemblance” (fig. 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  The snake was also lent to a 1968 exhibition on ancient and
                  modern Latin America at what was then the Isaac Delgado
                  Museum, later the New Orleans Museum of Art, and was part of a
                  1971–72 exhibition, <em>World of Wonder</em>, at the
                  Walters.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>

                <p>
                  From these rather unprepossessing beginnings, the Walters Art
                  Museum’s ancient American collections and program were
                  revitalized in the early 200s by significant gifts and loans,
                  including a long-terms loan from the Stokes family of Nyack,
                  New York; and, particularly, by a large gift from John Gilbert
                  Bourne, given in 2009. The Walters engaged Matthew Robb (whose
                  chapter on the St. Louis Art Museum is included in this
                  volume) as a Visiting Assistant Curator between 2000 and 2003,
                  and Khristaan Villela was a Consulting Curator of Arts of the
                  Ancient Americas from 2010 to 2011. Conservator Julie
                  Lauffenburger also played an important role in maintaining a
                  focus on these works in the 2010s. I was hired as the first
                  permanent Curator of the Art of the Americas in 2017, and
                  dedicated galleries for the collection will open in 2025,
                  finally enshrining in the twenty-first century a part of the
                  collection that began to be formed in 1897.

                  The Walters’s history stands in stark contrast to the
                  situation at the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA), an institution
                  in the same city with strikingly different conditions. The
                  museum was formed by a range of individuals who came together
                  to form a municipal museum. The driving force behind the
                  collection was not a visionary dealer like Kunz, who created
                  enthusiasm for a new collecting area, but the patrons
                  themselves. While the director, Adelyn Breeskin (Acting
                  Director 1942–47, Director 1947–62), and Chief Curator
                  Gertrude Rosenthal, who worked at the BMA in various
                  capacities from 1945 to 1969, were helpful, the main impetus
                  for a major collection of ancient American art came from the
                  donors themselves and was part of a larger push for a diverse
                  “primitive” art collection at the museum, a common interest at
                  midcentury. Real estate investor Alan Wurtzburger (1900–1963)
                  and his wife, Janet (1908–1973), were the source of the BMA’s
                  most significant collection of primitive art (figs. 7–9).

                <p>
                  Before it began seriously collecting primitive art, the BMA
                  presented several of the Pan-American exhibitions that were
                  circulated by the Office of Inter-American Affairs (OIAA) in
                  the 1940s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  It is interesting that these exhibitions were designed with
                  broad audiences in mind—the 1944
                  <em>Art in the Countries South of Us</em> exhibition was held
                  in the Junior Museum of the BMA and included toys, although
                  the BMA <em>News</em> noted that this gallery, “though
                  designed to familiarize children with our Latin American
                  neighbors, will include material of general interest to adults
                  as well.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  The 1944 exhibition paled in comparison, though, to the 1950
                  <em>Folk Arts of the South American Highlands</em> exhibition,
                  organized by the American Federation of Arts and shown at
                  several museums, including the Art Institute of Chicago. It
                  included about 160 works of ancient, colonial, and popular
                  arts from Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  From the images available, this was clearly a lush and costly
                  show to mount, with mannequins in one corner and weavings on
                  backstrap looms on another pedestal (fig. 10).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, a 1952 exhibition featured a bequest of
                  approximately six hundred Native American works from Maryland
                  resident Florence Reese Winslow, who later lived in the US
                  Southwest. A <em>Baltimore Sun</em> article suggested that
                  Frederic Douglas, curator of Native arts at the Denver Art
                  Museum, and an important impetus in the founding of that
                  ancient Americas collection, simply happened to be in in
                  Baltimore when the bequest was announced and was immediately
                  pressed into service cataloging and classifying the works in
                  the gift. He is pictured in the <em>Sun</em> article
                  surrounded by dozens of baskets.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Wurtzburgers’ gifts, then, bolstered and enhanced the
                  BMA’s forays into exhibiting and collecting primitive art. As
                  Frederick Lamp, former African art curator (1973–2004),
                  described it: “In 1953, Adelyn Breeskin . . . and . . .
                  Gertrude Rosenthal, were invited to lunch at Timberlane, the
                  Baltimore home of Alan and Janet Wurtzburger. Their meeting
                  was to result in the first significant formation of an African
                  collection at the museum, and the basis of the collection
                  today.” He continued, “At this luncheon [Alan] took Breeskin
                  and Rosenthal out to a separate lodge on the grounds, where he
                  showed them his new collection. They immediately decided to
                  mount a loan exhibition, which was produced in 1954 with a
                  catalogue introduced by Paul Wingert. A year later, the
                  Wurtzburgers donated the entire collection to the museum and
                  went on to begin other collections, first in Oceanic and then
                  in pre-Columbian art, with the express purpose of forming a
                  Wurtzburger Gallery of Primitive Arts at the BMA.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  Lamp further recounted that the Wurtzburgers became interested
                  in collecting primitive art when they were enlisted by their
                  friend, the department store owner Stanley Marcus, to select
                  African works for him to purchase when they were on a trip to
                  South Africa in 1950.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the couple didn’t find anything for the Marcus
                  collection at that time, they were entranced by primitive art.
                  They became friends with Douglas Newton, the curator of
                  African art at the Museum of Primitive Art, who introduced
                  them to experts, including Paul Wingert and Douglas Fraser,
                  who were also influential in the formation of the collection
                  of New York’s Museum of Primitive Art. Yet even with this
                  guidance, according to former Native American arts curator at
                  the BMA Katharine Fernstrom (1987–2002), the couple
                  “restricted their collecting to purchases from other
                  collectors and art dealers, rather than collecting ‘in the
                  field,’ because they could obtain the best pieces from these
                  sources.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After their gift of African art, by 1956 they had similarly
                  donated a collection of more than two hundred Oceanic works.
                  They also began purchasing Native American works: A 1956
                  profile asserted they were beginning their next collection in
                  Russia seeking to “uncover choice works of Pacific Northwest
                  Indian art collected by Russian seal hunters in Czarist
                  days.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Yet, two years after the Oceanic gift, they then donated a
                  collection of ancient American art, which was accorded its own
                  catalog, with collection notes by Yale scholar George Kubler.
                  In that same year, 1958, the Oceanic and African collections
                  plus 105 works of ancient American art were among the
                  approximately five hundred works exhibited in a new permanent
                  primitive art gallery. At least one journalist asserted that
                  “it is the new pre-Columbian section of the gallery that
                  compels the greatest interest at the present moment. While
                  neither so extensive as the Oceanic section, nor so rich in
                  major objects as the African, it is of greater antiquity than
                  either and entirely unfamiliar to art lovers.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>

                  Because of the breakneck speed of their collecting, the
                  Wurtzburgers were learning as they went. Their lack of
                  knowledge of and experience with much of the art, especially
                  the pre-Columbian works, meant that they had to depend heavily
                  on experts for guidance, and they bought from some of the most
                  established dealers of the era. Some works may have come from
                  Earl Stendahl on the West Coast, and one Zapotec effigy vessel
                  (<a href="https://collection.artbma.org/objects/23618/burial-vessel-in-the-form-of-the-rain-god-cocijo?ctx=d582b3ea4c319e25fc222cd2a176ce9a4ec1a7eb&amp;idx=0" target="_blank">BMA 1960.30.26</a>) still has a dealer’s sticker from the Galerie Charles
                  Ratton of Paris affixed to it. The couple may have leaned
                  toward works that had been published or promoted as
                  particularly strong in quality. One small Mixtec or
                  postclassic maskette of stone that ultimately ended up in
                  Wurtzburger collection passed through the inventory of the
                  influential Pierre Matisse Gallery of New York (fig. 11). An
                  advertisement of 1939 shows it was offered for sale by Matisse
                  in the year leading up to the monumental
                  <em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em> exhibition at the
                  Museum of Modern Art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Perhaps most importantly, like the Walters’ rattlesnake and
                  deity figure, it was published by Pál Kelemen in his
                  monumental <em>Medieval American Art</em> (1943),
                  demonstrating yet again how tightly woven is the web of
                  exhibitions, objects, publications, scholars, and dealers that
                  connect our different institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Pierre Matisse was also instrumental in restarting the
                  collecting of ancient American works by another pair of
                  husband-and-wife collectors, Louise (1879–1953) and Walter
                  (1878–1954) Arensberg. Walter was the son of an owner of a
                  Pittsburgh steel crucible, and Louise was the daughter of a
                  family that owned textile mills in Massachusetts. Once
                  married, the couple lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then
                  moved to New York around 1911. They began collecting modern
                  art from the Boston iteration of the Armory Show in 1913, and
                  it quickly became a driving passion in their lives. While they
                  were buying works by French modernists and actively
                  participating in the creation of the New York Dada movement,
                  they also bought at least three pre-Columbian works from the
                  Mexican dealer Marius de Zayas during the 1910s while living
                  in New York.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  But most of the almost five hundred ancient American works
                  were acquired after they moved to Los Angeles in 1921. Walter
                  Arensberg took his last trip to New York in 1937 and purchased
                  a red stone coiled serpent (<a href="https://philamuseum.org/collection/object/51138" target="_blank">PMA 1950-134-215</a>) from Matisse, as well as a number of works from the Brummer
                  Gallery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  The fact that Arensberg spent so much money on ancient
                  American works was either spurred or inspired by the Los
                  Angeles art dealer Earl Stendahl’s foray into this area;
                  around this time, he began selling works to the Arensbergs
                  almost weekly. I have previously written extensively about the
                  genesis and formation of the Arensbergs’ collection of ancient
                  American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Here, I will focus on how their collection ultimately ended up
                  in the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA).

                <p>
                  In 1940, the couple had agreed to donate their holdings to the
                  University of California, Los Angeles, as long as the
                  university’s museum created a new wing for them. When those
                  plans fell through, the gift was pulled. A few years later, in
                  1945, Katherine Kuh and Daniel Cotton Rich of the Art
                  Institute of Chicago visited. Kuh was a specialist in modern
                  Latin America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  But Kuh and Rich drastically reduced the number of
                  pre-Columbian works that were to be shipped to Chicago for
                  exhibition in juxtaposition with their modern works. This
                  greatly irritated the Arensbergs, and they severed their
                  agreement with Chicago by 1946. A few years later, Fiske
                  Kimball, the director at the PMA, stepped in to seal the
                  deal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                  Kimball and his wife, Marie, made several visits to the
                  Arensberg home and were in frequent contact with Sturgis
                  Ingersoll, president of the PMA’s board, to strategize how to
                  complete the gift (fig. 12). Marie Kimball and Louise
                  Arensberg seem to have formed a bond, and perhaps by 1950, the
                  Arensbergs, entering their seventies, were simply tired of
                  “shopping” the institutions that courted them. Although the
                  dissolution of the agreement with UCLA had been known for some
                  time, when the collection was to be shipped to Philadelphia,
                  it was apparently a surprise to the Los Angeles community, as
                  a 1951 newspaper cartoon illustrates (fig. 13). The
                  bespectacled East Coasters are shown carting off the small
                  Teotihuacan goddess (<a href="https://philamuseum.org/collection/object/51191" target="_blank">PMA 1950-134-282</a>) the couple owned. Reporter Kenneth Ross lamented the loss
                  of the Arensbergs’ “two and a half million dollar collection
                  of pre-Columbian and Modern art which every major city in
                  America except LA asked for.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  How, then, did Fiske Kimball succeed where Katharine Kuh and
                  Daniel Catton Rich failed? This story is one of triumph after
                  failure. Originally, the Arensbergs were quite insistent that
                  they wanted the fruits of all their lives’ labors to stay
                  together. Walter Arensberg, in particular, had three main
                  passions in life: modern artworks, particularly conceptual
                  ones made by Marcel Duchamp; ancient American sculpture,
                  especially large stone works of the Mexica; and proving that
                  Francis Bacon was the true author of the works commonly
                  attributed to Shakespeare. During his early attempts to find a
                  home for his art collection, Walter wanted all three parts of
                  the triumvirate to stay together in a given location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But by the time Kimball came to visit, Walter had been forced
                  to relax his standards. Although there were some early
                  discussions of merging the Francis Bacon Library, as his
                  research center was called, with the American Philosophical
                  Society in Philadelphia, these went nowhere, and the Bacon
                  Library ultimately stayed on the campus of the Claremont
                  Colleges near Los Angeles, while his art collections went
                  east.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  As curator Matthew Affron has recently described in his
                  account of how some of the world’s greatest modern art was
                  gifted to the PMA between 1943 and 1950, landing the Arensberg
                  collection was a success for Kimball only after a series of
                  missteps. Kimball had organized large temporary exhibitions of
                  the Chester Dale and Alfred Stieglitz collections, which
                  ultimately went, in part or in whole, to other institutions,
                  so by about 1950, he was highly motivated in his wooing of the
                  couple.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The PMA has had a complex construction history: A huge outer
                  shell opened in 1928, but only fifteen interior permanent
                  galleries were open to the public. Given that the Great
                  Depression began shortly after the exterior was complete, it
                  took decades to fully flesh out the permanent collections
                  necessary to fill the museum. However, the empty spaces meant
                  Kimball could be more nimble than other institutions in
                  expanding the collections. In the case of the Arensbergs,
                  Kimball used all his charm—and his drafting skills—to win
                  their collection for his museum.

                  The PMA archive holds a small drawing of the central hall of
                  the Arensberg galleries that Kimball promised the couple, with
                  Brancusi’s <em>Bench</em> sketched out, next to what appear to
                  be renderings of smaller Mexica deity figures and west Mexican
                  ceramics (fig. 14). In correspondence with his board chair,
                  Kimball revealed that his master stroke to seal the deal was
                  producing detailed sketches, including this drawing, planning
                  for “building your collection its dream house,” as Marie
                  explained to Louise. Kimball telegraphed his board chair in
                  excitement on February 7, 1949, when he succeeded in getting
                  Louise and Walter to initial this drawing, which they did at
                  bottom left—in essence formally accepting his proposal for
                  their collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  Although it would take many more months to hammer out the
                  final details of the agreement, Kimball and the PMA did not
                  flinch from the challenges—or the shipping costs—of
                  transporting a collection that included a large-scale corn
                  goddess, a stone basin, and, particularly challenging, a
                  greenstone Mexica calendar stone 33 inches across, nearly 20
                  inches high, and weighing some 1,380 pounds (<a href="https://philamuseum.org/collection/object/51311" target="_blank">PMA 1950-134-403</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>

                  Kimball recognized the extraordinary power of these works,
                  particularly the calendar stone, and centered them in the
                  first exhibition of the Arensbergs’ collection, which included
                  only their ancient American collection. It was installed in
                  1953 in a small special exhibition space, not yet the
                  galleries that had been expressly designed for their
                  collection (fig. 15).
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the spacing and lack of casework in this exhibition can
                  be odd for twenty-first century tastes, Kimball and his
                  designers were guiding a pre-Columbian installation that felt
                  very streamlined and contemporary, even before the Arensbergs’
                  modern works were added. The tilted platform is echoed by
                  zigzag shelves, which seem to riff on the Mesoamerican
                  pyramidal form. Also, the stone works are displayed on
                  pedestals, consciously marking them as art. I have not found
                  information as to the paint scheme for this gallery, but color
                  blocks would have set off the gray and brown of stone and
                  ceramic objects, with physical blocks elevating them to
                  different heights. Unfortunately, we do not have the
                  Arensbergs’ thoughts on this exhibit, for they did not see it:
                  Louise died in November 1953 and Walter in January 1954.

                <p>
                  In 1954, once the Arensbergs’ modern works arrived at the
                  museum, Kimball put the masterworks of the collection, both
                  modern and pre-Columbian, into the central gallery that he had
                  sketched out five years earlier (fig. 16). The Teotihuacan
                  mural fragment, dominated by reds, must have been startling
                  against the white walls. In this gallery, there was an
                  equilibrium of ancient works, mostly stone, and the modern
                  paintings and sculpture, all enclosed within the grid and
                  arched spaces of the gallery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Kimball really had created a “dream home” for the Arensberg
                  collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, the PMA’s strategy of pairing ancient American
                  works with European modern paintings and sculpture resonated
                  with only the most cerebral visitors. Despite the PMA out
                  maneuvering the Art Institute of Chicago for the Arensbergs’
                  collection, the PMA ultimately abandoned the original vison.
                  The museum complied with its agreement to keep modern and
                  ancient art displayed together for twenty-five years, but then
                  it quietly removed much of the ancient American material from
                  view. Perhaps this had to do with an informal agreement with
                  the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and
                  Anthropology (Penn) that stipulated that the PMA would accept
                  gifts of Asian art, while Penn would be home to African,
                  Oceanic, and ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  Whatever the reason, there has never been a dedicated curator
                  who specializes in art of the ancient Americas. In recent
                  years, major works from the PMA’s ancient American holdings
                  have been on view, though, on loan to the Princeton Museum of
                  Art and Penn.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The three museums discussed here all have drastically
                  different origin stories: One founded by a single man heavily
                  influenced by a single dealer to showcase craftsmanship and
                  luxury materials; one formed in just two years by
                  husband-and-wife donors looking to complete their collection
                  to fill a gallery of “primitive” art; and one developed by a
                  director willing to accession and ship thousands of pounds of
                  stone to avoid losing out on a major collection of modern art.
                  The legacies of these collections have also developed
                  unevenly, but there is a growing sense that there is a
                  new-found relevance and import to these collections of ancient
                  American art. In the twenty-first century, the Latino
                  populations in both Philadelphia and Baltimore, as well as the
                  country as a whole, are growing quickly and are eager to see
                  their history and heritage represented in US museums. As
                  institutions seek to make heritage more accessible to
                  descendant communities, there likely will be dedicated
                  curators who have knowledge and expertise in ancient American
                  art to engage these communities. And many such communities may
                  be surprised that those collections do exist, for it was not
                  only large institutions and those in largely Latino cities
                  that amassed works of ancient American art. Smaller museums
                  and those outside the major cities for art (New York, Chicago,
                  and later the West Coast and Texas) were also essential to the
                  network of dealers, donors, and directors that connected them
                  to larger museums and larger trends in the history of
                  collecting. Still by lending works, by keeping dealers afloat
                  through (sometimes smaller) acquisitions, by offering venues
                  for traveling Pan-American exhibitions, by making avant-garde
                  installation design choices, and by making their collections
                  available for key early publications, such as Kelemen’s
                  <em>Medieval American Art</em>, these museums helped to
                  create, expand, and make viable the web of ancient American
                  art on public view at midcentury.

                        articles and on websites as being a ground-breaking
                        gemologist and not in his role art from the ancient
