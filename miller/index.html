    <title>All in the Details | Collecting the “Other Americas”</title>

    <meta name="description" content="The term *pre-Columbian art* once described the material culture produced in the Americas, mostly south of the US-Mexico border, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Museums across the United States now refer to these departments as art of *the Americas* or *the ancient Americas*. Stewards of these collections in American art museums have begun confronting the changing meanings and import of what Nelson Rockefeller once described as the “other Americas.” This symposium volume captures the history of collecting and display of ancient American works in art museums, a history surprisingly poorly documented until now.">

                  During the symposium, works sourced from the Stendahl Art
                  Galleries were referred to in almost every presentation, from
                  museum collections in New York to Denver. Particularly before
                  1970, no other single art gallery or art dealer had such
                  impact in the formulation of museum collections in the area of
                  prehispanic art. At the symposium, scholars evaluated
                  individual institutional histories in the United States,
                  especially those of art museums, with respect to the civic
                  responsibilities shouldered by institutions and the
                  opportunities that different curatorial departments undertook,
                  sometimes with the engaged interest of individual collectors,
                  who sought to bring an institution in line with their own
                  passions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But none of these collections could have been formed without
                  the leadership of an extraordinary salesman: Earl Stendahl
                  (1888–1966). Stendahl invented the business of prehispanic
                  art. Before 1940, acquiring prehispanic art was often a more
                  touristic and haphazard entrepreneurial endeavor, with little
                  substantial difference between anthropology and art history.
                  Such blurriness was indeed the case once one stepped anywhere
                  outside of European and American collections of painting and
                  sculpture, including the arts of Africa and Oceania. Stendahl
                  marketed to collectors and to museums, and early on, he saw
                  the market value of securing venues that would drive other
                  sales, whether in the permanent collection of the Seattle Art
                  Museum or in the temporary exhibitions he organized locally in
                  southern California and internationally. And eventually there
                  would be other attendant effects: Acquisitions by museums
                  would become core works in survey texts and classroom
                  instruction.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Stendahl could have taught a course in market development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can learn today a great deal about how this market took
                  shape from the letters the family exchanged with one another
                  from the late 1940s until his death in 1966. Stendahl, his
                  son, Alfred (Al; 1915–2010), his wife, Enid (1889–1979), and
                  his son-in-law, Joe Dammann (1922–1971), all participated in
                  the family business and wrote letters to one another,
                  especially when conducting business away from Los Angeles. The
                  Getty Research Institute (GRI) has 357 of these family letters
                  in its holdings in box 105, part of the comprehensive archive
                  of the Stendahl Art Galleries (SAG) business documentation, an
                  archive that comprises stock books, photographs, and extensive
                  correspondence with dealers (e.g., Guillermo Echániz
                  [1900–1965] in Mexico), collectors (e.g., Nelson Rockefeller
                  [1908–1979], founder of the Museum of Primitive Art), and
                  museums (e.g., Dayton Art Institute and its director Thomas
                  Colt [1905–1985]). Held in folders at the end of the archive,
                  and many written on aerograms and other very lightweight
                  paper, these letters have rarely been consulted.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  The information in the letters sheds light on family life,
                  competitors, Los Angeles, and much more. Most of all, this
                  archive underpins the work conducted by the Pre-Hispanic Art
                  Provenance Initiative (PHAPI), dedicated to examining and
                  interpreting the business of selling ancient art of Latin
                  America in the United States and elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Explicit business correspondence was always important to Earl
                  Stendahl and the SAG, and starting in 1940, the gallery grew
                  to become the largest volume seller of prehispanic art in the
                  1960s in the United States. In 2021, the GRI published eight
                  letters between Earl Stendahl and Guillermo Echániz, written
                  over a period of fifteen months, from October 1940 until
                  January 1942.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  The shipping lanes to Europe and Asia from the United States
                  had closed at the beginning of the period of this
                  correspondence, and by January 1942, the United States was at
                  war with the Axis powers and mail was under federal scrutiny,
                  if not censorship. The SAG was just finding its way to
                  extensive business in Mexico and was dependent on Echániz.
                  These eight letters show the development of the business,
                  cultivating buyers Ambassador Robert Woods Bliss (1875–1962),
                  who had established the museum and research center Dumbarton
                  Oaks, in Washington, DC, with his wife, Mildred Barnes Bliss
                  (1879–1869), and Walter and Louise Arensberg (1878–1954;
                  1879–1953), who collected modern and pre-Columbian art, as
                  well as the slippery tactics undertaken to remove objects
                  illicitly from Mexican archaeological contexts and move them
                  across the border to the United States. Perhaps because of the
                  nature of the business or perhaps because of the censors,
                  Stendahl and Echániz often wrote in coded references.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The family letters, though, are different—unfiltered and
                  uncoded correspondence written a generation later, when the
                  business was in full swing. But “full swing” did not mean that
                  financial success was certain, even when the Stendahls had
                  developed multiple sources across multiple countries and a
                  worldwide clientele. They established a New York beachhead for
                  the business, and Earl and Enid became well-known at the best
                  hotels in Europe. Mail—and frequently international mail—was
                  the means by which the extended family worked, played,
                  criticized, and supported one another. Although on the surface
                  the family letters are the means of exchanging pleasantries
                  regarding weather, home maintenance, and notes of outcomes
                  from the racetrack, this correspondence is often revealing in
                  the private comments regarding the sales process and the
                  opinions of potential buyers. “I now feel strongly that Jan or
                  February sale is in order. Get what we can out of as much junk
                  as we can sell,” wrote Al to his father, probably in 1957,
                  describing the possibility of some high-volume, low-value
                  sales.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  On paper, Earl was tough on his son, Al, and son-in-law, Joe,
                  grousing about their failure to get accounts paid and paid
                  off. At home in Los Angeles, the gallerists could have
                  registered their complaints in person: From the road, the
                  letter was the recourse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As revealing as such comments may be, these letters are even
                  more important in their documentation, no matter how oblique,
                  of business practices. The focus of PHAPI is to reveal and
                  link these practices: While stock books and inventories
                  document the formal side of the practice, the family letters
                  point to the ways that three principals—Earl, Al, and
                  Joe—shared different responsibilities, from navigating works
                  across international borders to paying gardeners at the
                  gallery and expressing ire at unpaid invoices with frank
                  comments about friends and competitors. They also kept an eye
                  out for the opinions of archaeologists and art historians.
                  Because the SAG was the single largest vendor of prehispanic
                  art in its heyday, understanding the practices also helps
                  reveal the picture of the many routes by which such works
                  entered art museums. In many ways, working through the SAG
                  archive is akin to discovering a complete archaeological
                  stratum, one known only through the occasional trade object
                  encountered hither and yon. With these records the big
                  picture, year by year, can start to come into focus.

                  Unlike the data of the stock books, the content of the family
                  letters cannot be summarized: Their level of granular detail
                  resists the big picture, yet no big picture can be drawn
                  without them. The family letters show how Earl was always on
                  the hunt for more and better business, with private collectors
                  and museums across the world—and while cryptic, the letters
                  also show that Earl kept an enormous number of details in his
                  head, juggling purchases in Mexico with sales and purchases in
                  Europe. Failed business deals, rarely noted in the stock
                  books, are a regular feature of the family letters. In these
                  accounts, Earl kept an eye on his two younger partners (who
                  were more typically in Los Angeles) and the competition
                  emerging both nearby and in New York. He kept his “frenemies”
                  close: cajoling and collaborating with them. He expressed
                  bitterness at those sellers abroad, particularly in Mexico,
                  who gave a better deal or first choice to his US competition.
                  And he sought new avenues of promotion—from local exhibitions
                  to what became a Stendahl grand tour of European institutions
                  from 1958 to 1963. For a man who had once been poor, who would
                  turn time and again to his background as a candymaker when
                  times were tough, he had arrived both at home in Los Angeles
                  and beyond.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  By the time of his death in 1966, Earl penned letters home on
                  stationery from glamorous hotels in New York and abroad.

                  The rest of this essay includes portions of family letters. My
                  glosses and their specific focus point to a larger picture of
                  the SAG practice. The family letters are most dense and
                  interlocking from 1954 until just before Earl’s death in 1966,
                  and so small selections of these letters will be drawn from
                  those years, ending with a letter from December 1965 that
                  reveals a deal the SAG failed to make. Dozens of letters
                  document the five years between 1958 and 1963; addressed
                  briefly elsewhere, those letters focus on developing new
                  markets and new inventory, often of classical antiquities,
                  with much of the business conducted in Europe.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  To keep this essay focused on the prehispanic market in the
                  United States, the letters selected here date from 1954 to
                  1956 and from 1963 until 1965. Letters from Earl, Al, Joe, and
                  Enid all point to different aspects of the business, and each
                  has a very specific voice, from brusque to chatty, and when
                  speaking of the young children in the family, even tender.
                  Spelling and punctuation rarely meet the standards of the day
                  and are retained here. Dates have been reconstructed, by and
                  large, by the PHAPI project. Full transcriptions of the
                  letters can be found in the Appendix of this volume. The
                  selections that follow have been taken from larger contexts,
                  as seen in the illustration of the original letter in the GRI
                  archives.

                  Threaded through the family letters are sales of works by
                  European artists. Here, Al apparently shipped a Picasso out of
                  the Los Angeles International Airport. Did he build the crate
                  for the artwork? The letter is vague on that point.

                  Robert (Bob) Stolper (1920–2013) worked closely and
                  competitively with the SAG from 1950 until 1970 or so. He sold
                  prehispanic and other works of art in Los Angeles, New York,
                  and London and is the nonfamily member most widely referred to
                  in the family letters. He kept an apartment in Mexico City in
                  the 1960s, perhaps principally for making purchases. He seems
                  to have also kept an apartment at 11 East 68th Street in New
                  York (The Marquand, built in 1913), perhaps adjacent to the
                  Stendahls’ place in the same building. This letter was
                  presumably written in Los Angeles. What seems to have happened
                  is that Julius Carlebach (1909–1964) had called Stolper by
                  telephone from his home and gallery in New York, and Stolper
                  then dropped by the SAG. Al was eager to get it all down on
                  paper to his father. Carlebach sold a diverse “primitive”
                  inventory and purchased extensively from the SAG, as evidenced
                  in the stock books. Given the date of 1954, Carlebach (whose
                  gallery was at 943/937 Third Avenue) would have known the 1952
                  exhibition <em>Ancient Tarascan Art</em> at the Sidney Janis
                  Gallery, which consisted of loans or works on commission from
                  SAG. There is no known surviving archive of Carlebach today,
                  but he was one of the principal dealers to sell to Fred Olsen
                  (1891–1996), whose prehispanic collection is now at the Yale
                  University Art Gallery.

                  And who was Frederick Peterson (1920–2009), addressed next in
                  this letter? The author of <em>Ancient Mexico</em> (1959),
                  Peterson was a long-standing faculty member at the University
                  of West Virginia, who had documented thousands of prehispanic
                  objects in both public and private collections in the 1950s;
                  one copy of his documentation survives today at the University
                  of New Mexico.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  He was well connected in both Mexico and the United States,
                  and fake Maya codices, as discussed in this letter, circulated
                  both in 1954 and today.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  In what might seem to be a non sequitur, the letter connects
                  the codices to Jaina Island (an unlikely origin, all in all),
                  and April Dammann has recounted how Earl secured permission to
                  film on Jaina Island in 1952.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  He and his crew then proceeded to loot the island for a month,
                  filling oversized cases with dozens, if not hundreds of
                  figurines—so he was “damned lucky” with his timing, as Al
                  noted in the letter, especially as interest in Maya art ramped
                  up: Robert Woods Bliss and Nelson Rockefeller had both made
                  significant acquisitions of Maya objects by then. “Campeche”
                  is probably a shorthand reference to one of the Stendahl’s
                  Mexican partners operating in Yucatan, probably Alberto
                  Márquez or less likely José Maria Palomeque, to stay ahead of
                  other buyers, particularly Jorge Hauswaldt, a German émigré in
                  Mexico, and Echániz, Earl’s principal Mexican partner.

                  Several advisers and authenticators played key roles with
                  respect to the quality and integrity of the Stendahl
                  inventory. One of the most important individuals to dealers
                  and collectors in New York was Gordon Ekholm (1909–1987),
                  Mesoamerican curator at the American Museum of Natural History
                  (AMNH), who also advised Ernst Erickson (1893–1983) on
                  building the collection Erickson would donate to the AMNH.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Presumably written in New York, this six-page letter, written
                  over multiple days, noted that Robert and Mildred Bliss came
                  to examine works in a bank vault with Ekholm and perhaps a
                  “young Mexican,” although it is hard to follow the timing. The
                  “young Mexican” might be Jose Luis Franco, the Mexican
                  authenticator with whom Ekholm was friendly and who may have
                  been involved in the export of antiquities at some point.
                  Although dated 1954, at this point, Bliss was already planning
                  the book that would be published in 1957,
                  <em>Pre-Columbian Art: Robert Woods Bliss Collection</em>,
                  written by Samuel K. Lothrop, Joy Mahler, and William Foshag,
                  a spectacular coffee table book featuring the Bliss
                  collection. Earl has this book in mind as he begins to plan
                  the publication
                  <em>Pre-Columbian Art of Mexico and Central America</em>,

                    had a drink and wanted me to buy the necklace for $2400.00.
                    I did not. Had a chance to get plain to New Orleans so got
                    there about 7:30 P.M. Called Bliss to see if he would be
                    home on Thursday. Was so got into Washington about 6 A.M.
                    Went to bed left a call for 8:30 and was out to see Bliss
                    about 10 A.M.

                    jad necklass worth about 150.00 also a few other pieces.
                    Bliss was very happy when he saw it so he will pay me
                    $2700.00 for it. . . . Talked to Bliss about deal on Degas.
                    He will call me this morning. Told him I would phone you
                    about price of marble Hacha as he feels its too expensive
                    18000.00. I will make him a price of $15000.00. . . .

                  Earl continued to pursue Maya art, using a short layover in
                  Merida, Mexico, to meet with Alberto Marquez, a source for him
                  there (Earl declined to purchase a necklace), en route to New
                  Orleans and up to Washington, DC, to see Robert Woods Bliss,
                  perhaps his most significant client. The Degas painting at
                  Dumbarton Oaks today (<a href="https://museum.doaks.org/objects-1/info?query=Portfolios%20%3D%20%224034%22%20and%20Disp_Maker_1%20%3D%20%22Edgar%20Degas%22&amp;sort=0" target="_blank">HC.P.1918.02.(O)</a>) was not acquired from Stendahl, so this sale evidently did
                  not take place. The items that Earl showed to Bliss were
                  things he had presumably brought from Mexico City in his
                  luggage, acquired from someone whose name cannot be easily
                  deciphered. He quickly made $1,200 on the deal, selling Bliss
                  the carved mirror (also not a work at Dumbarton Oaks today),
                  and although he told Bliss he would consult Al on a price
                  reduction, he simply informed Al that the price on a “marble”
                  <em>hacha</em> (presumably
                  <a href="http://museum.doaks.org/objects-1/info/22925" target="_blank">PC.B.038</a>) would drop by $3,000.

                    Dr. Kaiser and his wife were down last week from Berkeley.
                    Came in at 3 in the afternoon Sat and did not leave until 3
                    in the morning. What a session. They purchased $12,500.00.,

                    later. A good deal for us. Eleanor and I go to Midland on
                    Thursday next week to have Thanksgiving dinner with Rock and
                    will continue on to Berkeley to deliver the things. Also to
                    seethe other two couple up there. I am sure that they will
                    all turn into excellent clients. Also think that I can seel
                    the Mosaic Jaguar to the one couple but if you feel you need
                    it back there and have a chance to sell it, I can make

                  Written four days before the assassination of President John
                  F. Kennedy, this letter elucidates how Earl’s son-in-law, Joe
                  Dammann, is thinking about the SAG’s new inventory and new
                  competition. Regardless of the context, the SAG picked up
                  useful intelligence from their clients. Noted in this letter
                  is George Clayton Kennedy (1919–1980), who bought from the SAG
                  but also from other dealers, especially in New York, including
                  Frances Pratt (1913–2003), a dealer at 31–33 West 12th Street
                  in Greenwich Village.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  But the big news was about Aaron Furman (1900–1975), who
                  probably sold more African and contemporary art than
                  prehispanic art in his gallery at 46 East 80th Street: In this
                  letter, he had a Maya stela from Guatemala for sale for
                  $60,000. An increasing number of dealers were working from New
                  York in the 1960s and focusing on Maya and Olmec inventory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The key new client here is Dr. William F. Kaiser of Berkeley,
                  who spent $12,500 in twelve hours. One can only imagine the
                  party that ended at 3 a.m. Joe described how he would seal the
                  deal by delivering the acquisitions to Dr. Kaiser in person in
                  a few days. He also had plans to visit other new clients.
                  Works from the collection of Dr. and Mrs. Kaiser are
                  periodically sold at auction; a notable Zapotec urn from the
                  collection was drawn by Adam Sellen.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Joe also describes a plan to sell the Mosaic Jaguar, a work
                  eventually published in <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> on
                  February 8, 1964, to accompany the article “Art from Nobody
                  Knows Where” that detailed the rampant looting in Mexico that
                  was feeding prominent collections in the US despite Mexican
                  laws prohibiting it. The Mosaic Jaguar was actually a blatant
                  forgery, and its location is not known today.

                    appartment and he had a very exciting evening looking at our

                    had Frank Caro come in to pass on it. Caro and his son were

                    bought it for 12000.00. . . . He also reserved the small
                    gold cup from Persia for $6000.00. He woud rather have the

                  A year later, things were on the up and up; Lyndon B. Johnson
                  had been elected president in his own right, and the economy
                  was booming. Earl wrote to Enid from New York, in the
                  apartment the SAG leased at 11 East 68th Street. He had just
                  had dinner, apparently in his own apartment, with Ernest
                  Erickson, the single greatest patron of prehispanic art in
                  this period at AMNH.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  The woman in Cleveland may be Mrs. Emery Norweb, a trustee at
                  the Cleveland Museum of Art (see Bergh, this volume). This
                  letter is further evidence of the SAG relationship with the
                  Heeramanecks, major dealers in Los Angeles and New York,
                  particularly of South and Southeast Asian art. Today the
                  Heeramaneck collection of prehispanic art is in the National
                  Museum, New Delhi, India, the sole such collection in that
                  nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The story that Earl went on to relate to his wife is downright
                  picaresque, a litany of key New York players in the art world:
                  Erickson introduced Earl to Dr. Arthur Sackler (1913–1987),
                  and they had a fine time examining works in the Stendahl
                  apartment, particularly an Amlash Bull. Sackler subsequently
                  brought his own art consultant, Frank Caro, a Chinese
                  specialist, to advise him. What follows points to, without
                  fully explaining, fuzzy documentation at the National Museum
                  of the American Indian (NMAI).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Frederick Dockstader (1919–1998), director of the Museum of
                  the American Indian, came to see Stendahl, ordered up $10,000
                  worth of objects, and Dr. Sackler was said to be footing the
                  bill. Earl considered himself lucky, especially in the gifts
                  that his clients also sent him, suggesting the exchange
                  economy between gallerist and collectors: Mrs. (Daniel) Michel
                  of Chicago sent him a dozen roses, and Jan Mitchell sent him
                  two cases of whiskey.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mitchell then threw a dinner party at Lüchow’s, his famous New
                  York establishment near Union Square, with the Easbys and
                  Ekholms in attendance, as well as Jane Powell (and husband) of
                  the Brooklyn Museum, Julie Jones, curator of pre-Columbian art
                  at the Museum of Primitive Art, and Ernest Erickson. Dudley
                  and Elizabeth Easby (1905–1973; 1925–1992) were important
                  figures in New York; Dudley was a Metropolitan Museum trustee,
                  and Elizabeth would be one of the curators of
                  <em>Before Cortes: Sculpture of Middle America</em> (1971), a
                  signature exhibition of prehispanic art in New York. Jane
                  Powell (1930–1993) left the Brooklyn Museum after a short
                  stint there and is better known as Jane Dwyer from her days as
                  director of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown
                  University. Julie Jones (1935–2021) would go on to become the
                  head of the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the
                  Americas at The Met for twenty-one years and curator emeritus
                  until her death in 2021.

                  The letter concludes with Earl’s travel schedule for the next
                  ten days or so in Europe and a request to Enid to ship Los
                  Angeles inventory on to New York.

                <p>
                  A few months after his letter to Enid, in early 1965, Earl
                  took a trip to Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, and then
                  returned to New York. Business was booming, and the SAG was
                  selling all sorts of antiquities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Minneapolis, Earl met with Samuel Sachs II (b. 1935), the
                  deputy director, later to be director, at the Detroit
                  Institute of Art (and then briefly at the Frick Collection),
                  and was able to propose numerous sales. In Chicago, he visited
                  more clientele: Raymond Wielgus (1920–2010), whose collection
                  is now in the Eskenazi Museum at Indiana University, and the
                  Art Institute of Chicago, where Alan Wardwell (1935–1999) was
                  the first Curator of Primitive Art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  In Detroit, Earl worked with curator Francis Robinson, selling
                  Amlash works that the SAG purchased during the European tour.
                  But the expensive object on offer in 1965 was a “Maya stone,”
                  optioned for $35,000, then reduced to $28,000, which Earl
                  indicated would be offered to Minnesota if Detroit took a
                  pass. Detroit did pass; it is possible that the monument Earl
                  referred to is
                  <a href="https://collections.artsmia.org/art/8545/stela-fragment-maya" target="_blank">Stela 2 from Piedras Negras</a>, now at the Minneapolis Museum of Art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Back in New York, Jan Mitchell was considered “hot” by the
                  SAG, which is to say “ready to spend money.” A paragraph
                  below, Mr. and Mrs. Noah Torno of Toronto are also “hot,” and
                  elsewhere in the letters and invoices, they are serious
                  shoppers. The Cohens, Dr. Sackler, “Cleveland,” Jay Leff—Earl
                  stayed on top of potential buyers, and by spelling them out in
                  this letter, he reminded Al and Joe to do the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was news for Earl to share as well: Another client Nasli
                  Heeramaneck (1902–1971) had had a stroke. And then Earl
                  waffled on shipping an object to a potential buyer, given its
                  condition and worried that, if the client actually saw the
                  work, the sale would fall through.

                    saying he will call in the P.M. By that time, Papa Mad. Says
                    with all we have done for Bill – he shows stuff to others
                    first – and as this stone has probably been peddled about –
                    he will not take. So – when Bill called, asking us to
                    breakfast Wed. A.M. (Westbury) Papa just say – “Too G.D.
                    Early” and hangs up – So – we do not know the Emmerich
                    decision. It was a Covering for an opening in a Cave –
                    <u>very</u> heavy. Would have been something to handle – Saw
                    a drawing – head of a tiger design – They both took “cracks”

                  From time to time, Enid’s letters—generally fewer in
                  number—make astonishing revelations. In a letter written in
                  December 1965, Enid recounted how Earl failed to close a deal
                  with William Spratling (1900–1967).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Matthew Robb and I have discussed elsewhere, this is the
                  first known notice of Chalcatzingo Monument 9 in New York and
                  the earliest specific attribution to William Spratling as the
                  agent of its removal from Mexico to the United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  No other member of the Stendahl family made note of the
                  aborted transaction with Spratling. Enid indicated that René
                  d’Harnoncourt (1901–1968), director of the Museum of Modern
                  Art and often consulted by Nelson Rockefeller, who founded the
                  Museum of Primitive Art in 1957, turned it down with a “curt,
                  negative, No.” From this letter it is difficult to determine
                  whether $4,000 was the full price or half of the price;
                  eventually gallerist André Emmerich (1924–2007) would sell the
                  monument to the Munson-Williams-Proctor Museum of Art in
                  Utica, New York, for $20,000. From other correspondence that
                  Robb and I have consulted, it is clear there was some doubt
                  about the work’s authenticity, and perhaps that is the source
                  of the dig at the end of the letter, making fun of curator
                  Elizabeth Easby, Robert Goldwater, director of the Museum of
                  Primitive Art, and Gordon Ekholm, whose opinion the SAG was so
                  often soliciting. Today Chalcatzingo 9 is back in the state of
                  Morelos, having been repatriated to Mexico.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  In this selection from the family letters, we see the arc of
                  about a decade at the SAG. The SAG took an apartment in New
                  York at the beginning of this period, so they were on the
                  scene as prehispanic business developed there with Frances
                  Pratt, Aaron Furman, and André Emmerich, noted in this
                  selection of letters, and also when Eleanor Ward, Alphonse
                  Jax, and Ed Merrin entered the trade. The Stendahls
                  successfully conducted business with art museums nationwide,
                  from Cleveland and Detroit to St. Louis, as well as sustaining
                  relationships with private collectors, many of whom were
                  building collections that would be foundational for museums.
                  Robert Woods Bliss is the best-known of these collectors and
                  Raymond and Laura Wielgus played an important role at the
                  University of Indiana. By the time of Earl’s death,
                  prehispanic art had permeated most US museums with
                  encyclopedic aspirations, and encyclopedic aspirations were
                  the rule of the 1960s and 1970s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The SAG successfully created a business with inventory that
                  could be acquired for a few dollars or several thousand
                  dollars. They launched exhibitions across the United States,
                  particularly in southern California and often at colleges, but
                  also at the Texas State Fair, and extensive catalogs document
                  SAG offerings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  They learned from collectors, museums, and other dealers,
                  constantly adjusting to capture new business. In the letters
                  cited here, Earl was very interested in Bliss’s plan to
                  publish a lavish coffee table book of his collection, noting
                  the handsome photographs and a $200,000 price tag and the
                  uncertainty of pulling it off. This 1957 book inspired Earl to
                  make plans with the publisher Harry N. Abrams for his own
                  monumental book project, the 1968
                  <em>Pre-Columbian Art of Mexico and Central America</em>, a
                  compendium of works sold by SAG over nearly thirty years,
                  establishing new areas of study and organizational principles
                  for the field. Earl died in 1966, before he could see the
                  project come to fruition, but the plans were well under way.
                  His son, Al, wrote the introduction and curator Hasso Von
                  Winning wrote the text, an opportunity he might not have had
                  without Earl’s death. This book quickly became an
                  indispensable reference, and the publication catapulted Von
                  Winning from a little-known researcher in Los Angeles into a
                  national figure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Stendahls, too, became national and international figures.
                  At the beginning of the decade addressed in this suite of
                  letters, they had a substantial number of regional clients,
                  especially from the motion picture industry, as well as key
                  national collectors such as Bliss and Rockefeller, but during
                  this decade they expanded their clientele dramatically,
                  building greater resilience into their business model. But
                  letters from 1963 onward address a new side of the business,
                  in which monumental works of stone were being stolen from
                  Mexico and Guatemala. Sales of works such as Piedras Negras
                  Stela 2 or Chalcatzingo Monument 9—and the attendant high
                  prices and their visibility—would attract international
                  attention of archaeologists and national governments alike.
                  The Stendahl Art Galleries would not see the picture emerging
                  for many years, but the 1970 United Nations Educational,
                  Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/convention-means-prohibiting-and-preventing-illicit-import-export-and-transfer-ownership-cultural" target="_blank">Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the
                    Illicit Export, Import and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural
                    Property</a>
                  as well as the 1972 bilateral agreement between Mexico and the
                  United States would mark the beginning of the end for the SAG.
                  The family letters were filed away, carefully preserved
                  historical documents that today yield exquisite details of a
                  unique Los Angeles business.

                        Pál Kelemen’s 1943
                        <em>Medieval American Art</em> featured many works from
                        the Brummer Gallery, and several of these objects would
                        pass through Stendahl Art Galleries (SAG). Both Michael
                        Coe’s 1966 books, <em>Mexico</em> and <em>The Maya</em>,
                        included SAG objects, as did George Kubler’s 1962 and
                        1975 editions of
                        <em>The Art and Architecture of Ancient America: The
                          Mexican, Maya, and Andean Peoples</em>. Not only did I follow these pioneers in my own work,
                        but many of the designations, from “Nayarit” style to
                        “Remojadas,” devolve from market practices established
                        by the SAG.

                        letters were scanned in early 2020, at the beginning of
                        the global COVID-19 pandemic. Staff members across the
                        GRI signed up to transcribe the family letters using the
                        Zooniverse crowdsourcing program. The handwriting of the
                        letters (they are rarely typed) is difficult to
                        decipher, and the spelling is erratic and nonstandard,
                        making transcription difficult. Using the Zooniverse
                        transcription as a basis, Getty staff have begun the
                        process of confirming transcriptions and assigning
                        identities to individuals named in the letters. Few
                        letters bear full dates, and most are indicated only by
                        “Thursday” or “March 3,” but the transcription team has
                        nevertheless been able to anchor most dates. I am
                        grateful to the Stendahl/Dammann family for their
                        careful retention of nearly eighty years of records and
                        their generous donation of these records to the GRI.
