                  The term “pre-Columbian art” once described the material
                  culture produced in the Americas, mostly south of the
                  US-Mexico border, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Museums
                  across the United States now refer to these departments as art
                  of “the Americas” or “the ancient Americas.” Stewards of these
                  collections in American art museums have begun confronting the
                  changing meanings and import of what Nelson Rockefeller once
                  described as the “other Americas.” This symposium volume
                  captures the history of collecting and display of ancient
                  American works in art museums, a history surprisingly poorly
                  documented until now.

                  Generally, museums offer a public platform for the
                  presentation and exploration of cultural narratives, memories,
                  and aesthetics. Increasingly, as these institutions grapple
                  with their complicated colonial pasts, curators have begun
                  investigating their collections’ origins to better understand
                  how they were formed, who contributed to their formation, and
                  how the objects were used to represent cultures, countries,
                  and identities. “Pre-Columbian” art once described the
                  material culture produced in the Americas prior to the arrival
                  of Europeans. Now, museums across the US typically use art “of
                  the Americas” or “of the ancient Americas” to describe these
                  objects produced south of the US-Mexico border. The shift in
                  terminology reflects the continuing effort to confront the
                  changing meanings and import of what collector Nelson
                  Rockefeller once described as the “other Americas.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-director-foreword-fn1" id="page-director-foreword-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This volume captures the history of collecting and the display
                  of ancient American works in art museums across the United
                  States. Beginning in the early to mid-twentieth century, the
                  frame of the art museum shifted the interest of these objects
                  from their ethnographic and anthropological context to their
                  status as works of art. Now, such art is frequently displayed
                  in conjunction with modern and contemporary Latin American
                  art—an acknowledgment of the Latine heritage woven into the
                  fabric of many of the cities in which the museums are
                  located—and a testament to the enduring relevance of ancient
                  cultures in contemporary life.

                  This history lays bare the sometimes questionable means by
                  which collectors and museums built their collections of
                  ancient American art. In September 2022, the Denver Art Museum
                  created a new Department of Provenance Research to expand its
                  commitment to ethical collecting practices. Provenance
                  research has always been an integral part of the museum’s
                  curatorial purview, and we are one of only a few US museums
                  with a department dedicated to guiding us in this ongoing
                  work.&nbsp;During 2023, the department and curatorial staff
                  increased accessibility of the museum’s collections by
                  prioritizing and posting more artwork and provenance histories
                  online. The museum’s provenance research web page was created
                  to provide a forum to regularly educate and update the
                  community on the progress of our work and document our past
                  and current repatriations to countries of origin. The
                  following papers are from the twenty-first symposium of the
                  Frederick and Jan Mayer Center for Ancient and Latin American
                  Art. The Mayers played a crucial role as benefactors to and
                  supporters of the ancient Americas collection. Their
                  generosity went beyond donating objects and included endowing
                  the department and its activities to ensure the continued
                  vibrancy of the field. Established in 2001, the center’s
                  purpose is to increase awareness and promote scholarship about
                  Latin America, including through exhibitions, conservation,
                  fellowships, and a rigorous schedule of symposia.

                  I applaud Victoria Isabel Lyall, Frederick and Jan Mayer
                  Curator for Arts of the Ancient Americas, and Ellen Hoobler,
                  William B. Ziff, Jr., Curator of Art of the Americas at the
                  Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, for organizing the 2023
                  symposium and for their dedication to advancing knowledge in
                  this field. I also recognize Jan Mayer, who, with her late
                  husband, longtime museum trustee Frederick Mayer, has provided
                  unwavering support to the department since 1968. On behalf of
                  the staff at the museum, I offer my deepest gratitude.

                        In a letter dated September 29, 1944, to René
                        d’Harnoncourt, who was the vice president in charge of
                        foreign activities at the Museum of Modern Art, Nelson
                        A. Rockefeller referred to Latin America as the “other
                        Americas.” The letter is part of a longer correspondence
                        that makes clear the intended reason for d’Harnoncourt’s
                        travels was to assess and report back the progress of
                        communism in the “other Americas.” Record group: III 4

                  In 2023, Ellen and I realized a dream long deferred: We
                  brought together in Denver many of our dearest curatorial
                  colleagues to consider the ways that American art museums
                  built their collections of ancient American art. People built
                  these collections. Curators, collectors, and directors around
                  the country influenced the choice of objects and their frame.

                  We are grateful to all the symposium participants for diving
                  into the histories of their collections and expanding our

                  Volumes require many hands and many heads to put together. A
                  special thank you to Paula Michelle Contreras, Curatorial
                  Assistant, Art of the Ancient Americas at the Denver Art
                  Museum, for the extraordinary assistance in pulling together
                  both the symposium and the Mayer Center’s first hybrid
                  digital-print publication. Valerie Hellstein, Managing Editor
                  in Publications and a magnificent editor, kept the project on
                  track and added many astute editorial insights. A big thank
                  you to Matt Popke, the museum’s developer, for his patience
                  and flexibility with this digital publication and his
                  knowledge of digital publications more broadly. I am
                  especially grateful to Lori Iliff, Renée Albiston, and Mac
                  Coyle, Denver’s provenance team, for their help in connecting
                  many dots between collections. Additional thanks to Leslie
                  Murrell for her additional proofreading and to Renée Miller,
                  Manager of Rights and Reproduction, for her invaluable
                  assistance and guidance. The museum’s photographer Christina
                  Jackson performed magic resizing and shooting additional
                  images as necessary, and Tasso Stathopulos designed the print
                  cover and overall look of the publication. We would also like
                  to thank Denver’s audiovisual staff, Dave King and Stephen
                  Tucker, for making the hybrid symposium run so smoothly and
                  for their help in coordinating presentations and questions
                  from our online audience. For their assistance from the
                  Walters Art Museum, thanks are also due to Matthew Affron,

                  The field of the ancient Americas, both as a discipline of
                  art-historical study and as a collecting department within art
                  museums in the United States, is comparatively young.
                  Initially grouped with the social sciences, the study of
                  ancient American aesthetics and culture emerged gradually.
                  While it is beyond the scope of this introduction to trace the
                  full history of the acquisition and display of these
                  collections within US art museums, this volume is the first to
                  bring together intertwined and local histories. Through the
                  lens of twelve art museums, this volume offers a broad
                  introduction to some of the key events, exhibitions,
                  historical context, and, particularly, the people from the end
                  of the nineteenth century to the present day that shaped this
                  history. While recent initiatives and volumes have brought new
                  focus on individual collectors of ancient American works, the
                  story of their acquisition and public display within art
                  museums is almost completely untold.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn1" id="page-intro-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  There is not even a comprehensive list, as exists in other
                  fields, of all the institutions that hold works in this
                  area.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn2" id="page-intro-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ancient Americas collections discussed here represent the
                  material output of communities living <em>south</em> of the
                  US-Mexico border, made prior to the arrival of Europeans.
                  Within the United States, this material has always been
                  temporally and geographically defined, rooted in the past, and
                  interpreted through a European lens. Previously referred to as
                  “primitive,” “Indian,” “pre-Columbian,” “prehispanic,” or “New
                  World,” the preferred term today for this material is “ancient
                  American.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn3" id="page-intro-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  This is admittedly imprecise, as the term “ancient” for the
                  European past refers to a period ending about 400 CE, whereas
                  the “ancient Americas” encompasses works made prior to the
                  arrival of Europeans in the Americas, over a millennium later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following essays describe how ancient American art has
                  been collected, exhibited, and, more broadly, how American
                  <em>art</em> museums constructed, and shaped, public
                  perception of its meaning from the nineteenth century to the
                  present.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn4" id="page-intro-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Even though the formation and functions of art museums have
                  changed over time, here we think of art museums as having “a
                  basic skeleton of three principal functions: collection,
                  research, and public programs.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn5" id="page-intro-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  In very general terms, museum personnel was responsible for
                  prioritizing the works’ aesthetic qualities over historical
                  importance and other factors, for making those works available
                  to scholars (and, occasionally, to the general public) for
                  study and artistic inspiration, and for organizing
                  exhibitions, publications, and lectures aimed at general and
                  scholarly audiences. Like libraries and archives, museums
                  serve as memory institutions, sites where cultural and
                  historical memories are preserved through a distinct
                  interpretive lens. Yet this framing has shifted many times
                  over the late nineteenth century through the twenty-first.
                  Recently, scholars have reevaluated the processes of narration
                  and the resignification of objects in museum exhibitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn6" id="page-intro-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  As interdisciplinary scholar James Clifford has remarked,
                  museums are “contact zones . . . as a collection becomes an
                  ongoing historical, political, moral <em>relationship</em>—a
                  power-charged set of exchanges, of push and pull.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn7" id="page-intro-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  That push and pull extends even to the terms used to refer to
                  this art. In this volume, authors use different terms to
                  describe museum collections, a reflection of this material’s
                  marginalized status within the field of greater art history.
                  One of the more popular terms has been “primitive art.” The
                  term has no inherent meaning, rather as anthropologist Shelly
                  Errington makes clear, the word “primitive” acts as a foil for
                  the progressive nation-states of Western society. Anything, or
                  anyone, falling outside the narrative of progress is
                  interpreted as lesser than: underdeveloped, unsophisticated,
                  unambitious.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn8" id="page-intro-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  The literary theorist Marianna Torgovnick has noted that the
                  term “primitive” implies an acceptance of “the West as norm
                  and . . . the rest as inferior, different, deviant,
                  subordinate, and subordinatable.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn9" id="page-intro-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Initially, art historians applied the term to fourteenth- and
                  fifteenth-century European art, before the height of the
                  Renaissance; however, by the late nineteenth century, it would
                  refer exclusively to non-Western peoples, societies, and their
                  aesthetic creations. Within the art market, the term became
                  nearly codified as referring to people and works from Africa,
                  Oceania, and the ancient Americas, sometimes including Native
                  American peoples of the US but rarely including Asia. In other
                  words, the term became a shorthand for subjects, peoples, and
                  territories colonized by European imperial powers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The term “primitive” and its associations proved remarkably
                  durable, despite the fact that the cultures and communities
                  referred to rarely shared any geographic, cultural, or
                  linguistic connections. Academic institutions have long since
                  disregarded the fictive unifying principles of primitive art;
                  however, the concept has persisted in the museum
                  organizational structure because of the existence of
                  departments stewarding collections representing the arts of
                  Africa, Oceania, and the Ancient mericas (AOAA) were often
                  called Primitive Art departments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn10" id="page-intro-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  A trope that unites the collections of these departments,
                  parodied by Errington in her book, is that of the “discovery
                  narrative,” a tale that recounts how people of note (she cites
                  the case of the artist Pablo Picasso) “discover” primitive
                  art, “rescue” it from obscurity, and “elevate” it so it can be
                  celebrated within the realm of “fine art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn11" id="page-intro-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Art historian Susan Vogel and artist Fred Wilson similarly
                  have addressed and poked fun at the supposed transformation of
                  a primitive art object from artifact to art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn12" id="page-intro-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While African and Oceanic (and at times Native American) art
                  have been called primitive, ancient American art has held a
                  unique place within this rubric. At different times, it has
                  been seen as primitive but also as the important production of
                  hemispheric neighbors, a uniquely American inspiration for
                  industrial design, and, in more recent years, an ancestral
                  source of inspiration and encouragement. Every museum’s
                  collection reflects these tensions and many other
                  considerations, including its financial resources, geographic
                  location, the historical moment(s) when it was collecting,
                  personnel working at a given time, and mission. The ten
                  chapters in this volume show how historical and cultural
                  factors have affected ancient American art’s inclusion and
                  framing within art museums and, ultimately, within the field
                  of art history. Not previously synthetically described or
                  analyzed, these four overarching factors include: the rise of
                  modernism, the use of ancient American motifs and techniques
                  for industrial design inspiration, <em>Indigenismo</em> in
                  Latin America and the United States, and Pan-Americanist
                  policies.

                  The Role of Modernism in the Acceptance of Ancient American
                  Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                  By the late nineteenth and especially early twentieth
                  centuries, there was a broader understanding of what
                  constituted fine art. The rise of photography meant that
                  mimetic realism no longer had to be the goal of art.
                  Accordingly, many artists began looking elsewhere for
                  inspiration and artistic goals. Many European modernists,
                  notably Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) and his circle, sought
                  inspiration in African art, but others also looked to ancient
                  American models. Art historian and archaeologist Barbara Braun
                  points to a range of international artists who were inspired
                  by these works for reasons of heritage, intellectual
                  curiosity, or aesthetic preference.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn13" id="page-intro-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The leap from artifact to <em>objet d’art</em> resulted from
                  fundamental shifts in signification that occurred during the
                  nineteenth century when ancient American collections ceased to
                  be the exclusive province of natural history museums. A 1912
                  exhibition of Maya works at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,
                  has long been assumed to be the first presentation of these
                  works <em>as art</em> in an American art museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn14" id="page-intro-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Although it included approximately one hundred items from
                  Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, the
                  notice of the exhibition was only one-and-a-half pages long
                  and was situated between longer articles that enthused over
                  the acquisition of a single Chinese artwork.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn15" id="page-intro-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  The notice was written by the exhibition’s curator, Alfred
                  Marston Tozzer, a Harvard anthropologist. Tozzer closed the
                  notice by explaining that the exhibition would “show visitors
                  ignorant of the field of American archaeology that there was
                  something in this country in pre-Columbian times worthy of the
                  name of art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn16" id="page-intro-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  As anthropology museums became popular with modern artists,
                  the works they contained became sources of artistic
                  inspiration. For example, American artist Max Weber
                  (1881–1961) composed an ode to a Chac Mool figure at the
                  American Museum of Natural History.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn17" id="page-intro-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  British critic Roger Fry, who was a champion of European
                  modernism, was also cited by Braun and others as key to
                  changing attitudes about ancient American works. Fry greatly
                  influenced artist Henry Moore (1898–1986) to embrace ancient
                  American forms, particularly through his essay “American
                  Archaeology” that first appeared in November 1918. Here, Fry
                  observed that “it is only in this century that, after
                  considering them from every other point of view, we have begun
                  to look at [ancient American objects] seriously as works of
                  art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn18" id="page-intro-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  In the 1920s, as Mexican Muralism, fed by ancient American
                  sources, gained popularity, Fry’s was one of the few available
                  essays by an art critic that was available to English-speaking
                  readers.

                  These readers could also become collectors. Though there was
                  no cultural affinity or connection between works from Africa,
                  Oceania, and the ancient Americas, they were often shown
                  together, and dealers of African art, including many mentioned
                  in this volume—Charles Ratton, Pierre Matisse, the Brummer
                  Galleries—sold works from the ancient Americas as well. These
                  merchants also often sold modern art and catered to those who
                  were interested in it. Indeed, it was these dealers, and later
                  curators, who promoted ancient American art within modernist
                  circles. Errington locates the emergence and
                  institutionalization of “authentic Primitive” art in the years
                  between 1935 and 1984.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn19" id="page-intro-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  At the beginning of this period, in 1935, curator James
                  Johnson Sweeney organized the exhibition
                  <em>African Negro Art</em> at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).
                  He wrote of the vitality of the “plastic forms” of African
                  art, a term that would be applied over and over again to
                  ancient American works as well.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn20" id="page-intro-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Those works that hewed closest to the ideal of the primitive
                  were often those with great formal simplicity. The more
                  stripped down and abstracted, the better. Those who created
                  such works could also be imagined to have extremely simple,
                  harmonious lives, to have lived in a former paradise as “noble
                  savages.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn21" id="page-intro-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Sweeney would go on to an illustrious career, with his final
                  role as a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, where
                  he curated art of the Ancient Americas (see Koontz, this
                  volume.) Other modernist curators were also some of ancient
                  American art’s strongest champions. As Elizabeth Pope
                  discusses in her essay on the Art Institute of Chicago,
                  curator Katherine Kuh moved from organizing shows on José
                  Clemente Orozco (1883–1949) to collecting the ancient art that
                  had inspired him and other Latin American artists.

                  By the 1930s, some US museums were codifying the concept of
                  primitivism with the creation of curatorial departments that
                  oversaw these culturally unaffiliated regions of Africa,
                  Oceania, Ancient Americas (and sometimes including the
                  addition of Native American art). The Metropolitan Museum of
                  Art’s collection began as part of the Museum of Primitive Art
                  (see Pillsbury, this volume), and both the Cleveland and
                  Baltimore Museums of Art had departments known as “Primitive
                  art” (see Bergh and Hoobler, this volume). And while they did
                  not use the term “primitive” in their department names, the
                  Brooklyn Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago, as well as
                  many other US museums, used similar structures (see Rosoff and
                  Pope, this volume).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the increasing interest in ancient American art among
                  the promoters of modernism, it never exactly epitomized what
                  most considered primitive art. William Rubin, former director
                  of MoMA and curator of celebrated and reviled exhibitions on
                  this topic, felt that pre-Columbian art was more properly
                  called “courtly” or “theocratic” art along the lines of
                  ancient Egyptian and Persian art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn22" id="page-intro-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  According to Rubin, ancient American works’ odd position
                  within primitivism was due to their naturalism, workmanship,
                  and fine finish, particularly the Maya carved stone stelae,
                  which exceeded what modern artists sought in primitive
                  art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn23" id="page-intro-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  That is, although west Mexican ceramic figurines were embraced
                  by artists in Mexico and the US, other art traditions in the
                  Indigenous Americas, like Maya sculpture, were “too polished”
                  for collectors of primitive art. Despite its uneasy status as
                  primitive art—or maybe precisely because of it—many
                  institutions, including the Cleveland Museum of Art, the
                  Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and, surprisingly, the Museum of
                  Primitive Art in New York, actively sought Maya stelae for
                  their collections in the mid-twentieth century with an aim to
                  present them precisely as exquisite examples of artistic and
                  aesthetic achievement (see Bergh, Koontz, and Pillsbury, this
                  volume).

                <p>
                  In fact, this aesthetic achievement was key to the collecting
                  and acceptance of works from the Indigenous Americas from the
                  late nineteenth to about the mid-twentieth centuries. The term
                  “ancient American art” includes work from a huge geographic
                  region, across thousands of years, and from numerous cultures.
                  Some works, like west Mexican figures, were ceramics that did
                  not seek to convey mimetic realism and whose details, to the
                  modern eye, appear imprecise and broadly painted. However,
                  many other art traditions, such as Colombian and Panamanian
                  gold, Andean textiles, and Mixtec and Nasca ceramics,
                  exemplify the highest virtuosity in their craftsmanship. Some
                  of the earliest collections of ancient American art chronicled
                  in this volume, including at The Metropolitan Museum, the
                  Brooklyn Museum, and the Baltimore Museum of Art, were amassed
                  with the idea that they would serve as sources of inspiration
                  for US fashion, textile, and industrial design (see Pillsbury,
                  Rosoff, and Hoobler, this volume).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn24" id="page-intro-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Herbert Spinden, the curator at the Brooklyn Museum, observed
                  that national industrial design should “take its inspiration
                  from the materials, designs, and craftsmanship of the
                  indigenous peoples of the Americas, and with which Americans
                  could identify and be proud.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn25" id="page-intro-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  As Lauren Whitley has written, the conclusion of the First
                  World War stimulated the interest in an American design
                  identity independent from Europe, prompting scholars such as
                  Morris de Camp Crawford to research museum collections and
                  create the textile industry’s “Designed in America” campaign
                  in conjunction with The Met, the American Museum of Natural
                  History, and <em>Women’s Wear</em> publications. The campaign
                  proved a training ground for young designers who took
                  inspiration from ancient Americas textiles, among other
                  cultural designs, housed at these institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn26" id="page-intro-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>

                <h2><em>Indigenismo</em> in Latin America</h2>
                <p>
                  The Indigenous peoples of the Americas became an inspiration
                  to the newly minted republics across Latin America. As
                  boundaries were redrawn and independent economies developed,
                  the nascent formation of national identity and consciousness
                  took place simultaneously. How to represent the nation on the
                  world stage? How to reconcile the many communities living
                  therein: Indigenous (Native ethnic groups), mestizos
                  (mixed-race peoples), and <em>criollos</em> (mostly white
                  descendants of Spanish colonists)? As the nineteenth century
                  progressed, criollos across Latin America began to see the
                  “Indian” as the “bedrock of a nation.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn27" id="page-intro-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  Art historian Natalia Majluf’s critical examination of
                  Francisco Laso’s <em>oeuvre</em>, for example, demonstrates
                  how Indigenous imagery became integral to the forging of a
                  national identity rooted in the Indigenous communities of
                  Peru, heirs to the ancient peoples of that land.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn28" id="page-intro-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Eventually, this focus on Indigenous peoples of Latin America
                  evolved into <em>indigenismo</em>, an ideology that focused on
                  “describing, explaining, and designing public policies for
                  [Native] ethnic groups.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn29" id="page-intro-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  Indigenismo took many forms across the region, even within a
                  single country.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn30" id="page-intro-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Sociopolitically, policies ranged from beneficial reforms
                  promoting greater participation of Indigenous members to
                  full-scale assimilation into a modernized society. Culturally,
                  indigenismo valorized Indigenous artisans and their materials,
                  techniques, and style. By celebrating and aestheticizing
                  Indigenous-made objects and textiles, Latin American
                  intellectuals and artists characterized these works as the
                  singular legacy of the intellectual and technological
                  achievements of the prehispanic peoples, giving visibility to
                  oft-ignored communities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn31" id="page-intro-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A single definition of indigenismo cannot be offered because
                  its expression within sociopolitical and cultural realms
                  diverged greatly.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn32" id="page-intro-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  Over the course of the next eight decades, this nuanced, and
                  often fraught, ideology would undergo various evolutions,
                  especially between 1920 and 1930 and again in the 1950s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn33" id="page-intro-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Latin American artists would play a critical role in
                  disseminating the perceived importance of ancient American
                  culture within their own countries and transnationally,
                  eventually making an impact on their northerly neighbors, the
                  United States. The indigenismo that would be exported,
                  however, would bring with it the many inherent contradictions
                  and paradoxes that developed alongside it.

                  Following the Mexican Revolution, artists like Orozco, Diego
                  Rivera (1886–1957), and David Alfaro Siqueiros (1896–1974)
                  promoted Indigenous visual imagery from the ancient Americas
                  as an integral part of Mexico’s national identity. Siqueiros
                  memorialized this idea in his 1923 manifesto, asserting, “The
                  art of the Mexican people is the most important and vital
                  spiritual manifestation in the world today, and its Indian
                  traditions lie at its very heart.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn34" id="page-intro-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Similarly, Colombia’s Luis Alberto Acuña (1904–1994), who
                  published the first monograph of Colombia’s “Indian” art,
                  promoted a Native art history rooted in Colombia’s
                  pre-Columbian past.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn35" id="page-intro-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Peru’s José Carlos Mariátegui (1894–1930), founder and editor
                  of the periodical <em>Amauta</em>, and his collaborator,
                  artist José Sabogal (1880–1956), promoted Indigenous heritage
                  as that which distinguished Latin America from Europe. When
                  asked about his preference for Indigenous inspiration, Sabogal
                  responded, “Why yes we are cultural
                  <em>indigenistas</em> because we look for an integral identity
                  with our soil, its humanity and our time.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn36" id="page-intro-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  <em>Amauta</em>, a Quechua word that translates to
                  <em>maestro</em> or counselor, exemplifies Mariátegui’s
                  privileging of the Indigenous perspective as he simultaneously
                  forged a pan-American space for the avant-garde.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn37" id="page-intro-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Artists, poets, and intellectuals of the 1920s and ’30s mined
                  the iconography and visual imagery of pre-Columbian cultures
                  to depict the glories of their regional, ancient pasts and at
                  the same time to signal their new nations’ unique modernity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite its brief life (1926–30), Mariátegui’s journal
                  presaged an interest in forging transnational connections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn38" id="page-intro-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  Politically, this was realized during the first Inter-American
                  Conference on Indian Life, in Pátzcuaro, Michoacán. Its
                  principal objectives were “to comprehensively improve the life
                  of the indigenous groups of America” and to “uphold and defend
                  their cultural particularities.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn39" id="page-intro-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  At the conference, Mexico founded the Instituto Indigenista
                  Inter-Americano (IIIA) and named Moisés Sáenz its inaugural
                  director. Sáenz promoted cultural plurality and integration
                  and advocated those representatives from Indigenous
                  communities be present at the conference; however, after
                  Sáenz’s sudden death, anthropologist Manuel Gamio replaced
                  him. Gamio instituted an “apolitical and scientific” approach
                  to indigenismo: in other words, a modern ethnography that
                  excluded Indigenous voices from the conversation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn40" id="page-intro-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  Despite the desire to preserve and promote Indigenous culture
                  as part of a modern, national dialogue, the actual material
                  conditions of contemporary Indigenous communities did not see
                  similar support and modernization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn41" id="page-intro-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  The IIIA would go on to found its own periodical,
                  <em>América Indígena</em>, whose imagery and graphics would be
                  foundational in creating an “an inter-American indigenist
                  imaginary.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn42" id="page-intro-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  As anthropologist Deborah Dorotinsky has argued, the nature of
                  the editorial design, logo, and the choice of illustrative
                  woodprints created a certain uniformity in the depiction of
                  Indigenous peoples across the Americas, counteracting the
                  supposed objective of the larger indigenismo movements in both
                  the political and cultural sphere.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn43" id="page-intro-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  This would have ramifications in continental policies, and as
                  other scholars have noted, this would influence the display
                  and presentation of ancient American- and Indigenous-made art
                  within the museum space.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn44" id="page-intro-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>

                  The embrace of Indigenous cultures by modern Latin American
                  artists furthered the link between ancient American art and
                  modernism. Not only did they adopt the visual vocabularies of
                  the ancient past, but they also began collecting works for
                  their own artistic inspiration and enjoyment. As works by the
                  Mexican muralists became desirable for collectors and
                  influential for the burgeoning abstract artists in the US
                  during the mid-twentieth century, ancient American objects
                  became even more attractive to collectors and institutions
                  outside of Latin America.

                  Leading proponents of indigenismo such as Miguel Covarrubias
                  (1904–1957) would have an outsize influence on the
                  presentation of ancient American material in the United States
                  both through publications—content as well as editorial
                  design—and in museum exhibitions such as
                  <em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em> at MoMA. They
                  imparted their pride for the Indigenous-made materials of
                  their homelands but conversely brought an idealized, and
                  falsely homogenized, understanding of what Indigenous
                  community life was like.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn45" id="page-intro-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>

                <h2>The Rise of Pan-Americanism</h2>
                <p>
                  The final development that influenced the popularization of
                  ancient American art in US art collections was the political
                  movement known as Pan-Americanism. The embrace of ancient
                  American art by Latin Americans, and then by US artists,
                  coincided with several geopolitical trends that turned the
                  United States’ attention toward Latin America. Pan-Americanism
                  saw two periods of popularity in the nineteenth and twentieth
                  centuries, corresponding to greater US interest in strategic
                  alliances with Latin America. The term was first used in
                  reference to the independent nations of the Americas in the
                  context of the First International American Conference of
                  American States, held in Washington, DC, in 1889–90.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn46" id="page-intro-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Part of this first wave, which reached its apogee with the end
                  of World War I, was an interest in Latin American antiquities.
                  It encompassed the belief that the societies of ancient Latin
                  America might offer a more peaceful and beautiful alternative
                  to recent experience. British critic Roger Fry (cited above)
                  championed this view, as well as art historian Walter Pach
                  (1883–1958). One of the organizers of the 1913 Armory Show,
                  also known as the International Exhibition of Modern Art, Pach
                  was an important champion of Indigenous American art from the
                  United States and particularly from south of the US
                  border.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn47" id="page-intro-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another important driver of this early version of
                  Pan-Americanism and accompanying interest in the arts of the
                  ancient Americas was a series of World’s Fairs in the late
                  nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These represented
                  opportunities for countries to share their visual culture with
                  the public and with US museums, which sometimes bought or
                  accepted examples of ancient American art at the conclusion of
                  the fair. The fairs’ visitors experienced authentic works of
                  art and material culture as well as replicas, such as the
                  plaster casts of the Labná arch, a monumental Maya gateway
                  from western Yucatan that was a star attraction at the 1893
                  Chicago World Columbian Exposition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn48" id="page-intro-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it is the Pan-Americanism that became politically, and
                  later aesthetically, institutionalized in the 1930s through
                  the 1950s that is much better known. Pan-Americanism
                  intertwined with modern art by the early 1930s, as certain
                  major exhibitions, notably MoMA’s 1933
                  <em>American Sources of Modern Art</em>, juxtaposed ancient
                  and modern works to highlight formal and subject-matter
                  similarities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn49" id="page-intro-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  Beginning in the 1930s, some US politicians began to cite an
                  ideal of Pan-Americanism related to the unity of the nations
                  of the Western hemisphere. In the same year as
                  <em>American Sources</em>, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Good
                  Neighbor Policy espoused ideals of nonintervention and legal
                  equality among these nations to promote cooperation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn50" id="page-intro-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even as many resisted accepting a broader hemispheric past or
                  cultural unity, there were strategic interests at work. By the
                  late 1930s, Mexico and Latin America were becoming of greater
                  strategic importance as the winds of World War II began to
                  blow. The Office of Inter-American Affairs (OIAA), originally
                  the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs
                  (CIAA), was active between 1941 and 1946 and headed by Nelson
                  Rockefeller (see Pillsbury, this volume). Rockefeller’s
                  curator, René d’Harnoncourt, directed the Art Section of the
                  CIAA and coordinated a large number of exhibitions that sought
                  to show Latin American nations as worthy allies with
                  sophisticated and intriguing cultures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn51" id="page-intro-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  These smaller Pan-American exhibitions contained folk art,
                  modern art, even toys and utilitarian objects, but they often
                  also included ancient art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the most successful such exhibitions, much larger and
                  more complex than the ones described above, was jointly
                  organized between MoMA and the Mexican government—<em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em>
                  in 1940.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn52" id="page-intro-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  As its title suggests, the show brought together art from four
                  categories: pre-Spanish, colonial, folk, and modern art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn53" id="page-intro-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  It was co-organized by archaeologist Alfonso Caso (1896–1970)
                  and the artist Covarrubias, whose illustrations, cartoons, and
                  paintings of heroic Indigenous peoples of the Americas would
                  fill popular books he authored on the subject.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn54" id="page-intro-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  Both he and Roberto Montenegro (1887–1968), curator of the
                  folk art section, frequently depicted and drew inspiration
                  from ancient American art, which they also collected and
                  occasionally sold.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn55" id="page-intro-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  The exhibition was held at a nadir of US-Mexico relations in
                  the wake of the expropriation of Mexico’s oil resources and
                  played a key role in smoothing strained relations between the
                  two nations. It also pointed to how Pan-Americanism could help
                  with the commercialization of the ancient American past—the
                  New York department store Macy’s sold works of modern art by
                  Orozco and Siqueiros, as well as replicas of ancient Mexican
                  gold, of the kind shown in the exhibition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn56" id="page-intro-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  They were, however, bested by Gimbel’s, a few blocks away,
                  which sold actual ancient works from Peru in the same
                  year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn57" id="page-intro-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While <em>Twenty Centuries</em> marked a highwater mark of
                  Pan-American exhibitions, it was far from the last. Shortly
                  after, Herbert Spinden, of the Brooklyn Museum, embarked on a
                  six-month speaking tour through Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and
                  Argentina. Spinden took the occasion to collect and accession
                  about 1,400 objects from eight Latin American countries. Many
                  of these were immediately included in the 1941–42 presentation
                  <em>America South of U.S.</em> at the Brooklyn Museum, while
                  others were included in six exhibitions that Brooklyn
                  organized for the CIAA (three on ancient American themes and
                  three on colonial and folk art). According to curator Diana
                  Fane, “These exhibitions toured schools and public
                  institutions throughout the United States for more than a
                  decade starting in 1942.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn58" id="page-intro-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  While these exhibitions can be read as a barometer of the
                  rising status of ancient American art within museums at the
                  time, they also signal its falling. As the Brooklyn Museum’s
                  Chief Curator Kevin Stayton mused about Spinden, “It’s not an
                  accident that we sent an expedition in 1941. This was a
                  last-ditch effort to weave together the Americas and ignore
                  Europe during World War II, at a time we thought we could
                  still get away with that. . . . And it is also no accident
                  that the collection disappeared into our storerooms when
                  achieving hemispheric unity receded in importance.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn59" id="page-intro-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  During 1944–45, Rockefeller sent d’Harnoncourt on a
                  two-and-a-half-month tour of Latin America that included
                  visits to Mexico, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil in order
                  to “undertake a careful survey and prepare a report for this
                  Office on propaganda activities being carried out by foreign
                  powers in the other American republics.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn60" id="page-intro-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  The OIAA was concerned about developing trends and how best to
                  prepare for the postwar political landscape. But by the 1950s,
                  the US-Mexico relationship had irrevocably changed, and the
                  spirit of Pan-Americanism began to wane. Postwar US power on
                  the world stage had become great enough that it did not need
                  to seek the same strategic, cultural alliances with Mexico
                  that it once had. Interest in organizing international
                  traveling exhibitions focused on the ancient Americas would
                  diminish until the mid-1980s and ’90s, when the North American
                  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) began to be drafted and
                  ultimately passed, and major Latin American exhibitions were
                  mounted with cooperation and support from nations of the
                  region.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In response to the important trade relations in the American
                  continent as well as the burgeoning Latine population in the
                  United States, several notable large-scale exhibitions have
                  resulted from international collaborations in the first
                  decades of the twenty-first century. The Los Angeles County
                  Museum of Art (LACMA) stands out as having organized the
                  lion’s share of exhibitions, including
                  <em>Lords of Creation: The Origins of Sacred Maya Kingship</em>
                  (2006),
                  <em>Olmec: Colossal Masterworks of Ancient Mexico</em>
                  (2010–11),
                  <em>Contested Visions in the Spanish Colonial World</em>
                  (2011–12),
                  <em>Children of the Plumed Serpent: The Legacy of Quetzalcoatl
                    in Ancient Mexico</em>
                  (2012),
                  <em>The Portable Universe: Thought and Splendor of Indigenous
                    Colombia</em>
                  (2022), and most recently,
                  <em>We Live in Painting: The Nature of Color in Mesoamerican
                    Art</em>
                  (2024–25). Perhaps because of its position on the West Coast,
                  a region, and specifically a city, with deep ties to Latin
                  America, or because of the strength and vision of its
                  curators—Virginia Fields (1989–2011), Ilona Katzew
                  (2000–present), Diana Magaloni (2013–present)—or support by
                  its director, Michael Govan (2006–present), LACMA-organized
                  exhibitions challenged the field of Ancient Americas to grow
                  beyond its original parameters. By far the most complex and
                  ambitious exhibition of the ancient Americas to date was
                  <em>Golden Kingdoms: Luxury and Legacy in the Ancient
                    Americas</em>
                  (2017–18), a collaboration between the Getty Museum and The
                  Met, curated by Joanne Pillsbury, Tim Potts, and Kim Richter,
                  that involved numerous Latin American countries. Today, the
                  ability to mount such ambitious international collaborations
                  going forward is in doubt. The financial and diplomatic
                  resources necessary for such undertakings are in increasingly
                  short supply.

                <h2>History of the Project</h2>
                <p>
                  This volume arose from our own shared interest in the history
                  of collections and a desire to understand the threads, both
                  personal and historical, that connected institutions and
                  collections to one another. As curators, we were interested in
                  the modes of display and the interpretive frameworks applied
                  to ancient material from Latin America. We asked ourselves why
                  collections on the West Coast looked so different from those
                  on the East Coast. What determined the nature and character of
                  different institutional holdings?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inspired by published histories on the development and
                  representation of other “non-Western” collections that
                  considered both the acquisition and display of Native American
                  and African art, we sought a similar synthetic treatment for
                  the ancient Americas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn61" id="page-intro-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  We found none. In 2017, no volume on the origins of ancient
                  American art in US art museums existed. Interest in the
                  connections between collections, museums, and diplomacy appear
                  in Elizabeth Hill Boone’s edited volume,
                  <em>Collecting the Pre-Columbian Past</em> (1993),
                  specifically Holly Barnet-Sánchez’s pivotal essay on the 1940
                  exhibition at MoMA, and in Shelly Errington’s
                  <em>The Death of Authentic Primitive Art and Other Tales of
                    Progress</em>
                  (1998). Errington addressed key periods of collecting and
                  exhibition design, especially the impact of display techniques
                  and the national rhetoric around pre-Columbian cultures and
                  their political role for US-Latin American relations during
                  the interwar and postwar periods.

                  We had each begun investigating specific collections and
                  institutions and saw how the histories of these collections
                  might be held as a mirror to broader institutional and
                  regional histories. Our growing interest in the topic happily
                  coincided with two key recent developments in pre-Columbian
                  art history: the appointment of Mary Miller as director of the
                  Getty Research Institute and her development of the
                  Pre-Hispanic Provenance Initiative (PHAPI) and several art
                  museums across the United States deciding to reinstall their
                  ancient Americas collections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn62" id="page-intro-fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  This confluence of events provided a moment to reflect and
                  reconsider the institutional histories of these collections:
                  both the lives and representations of objects as well as the
                  ways in which these works have been used to represent Latin
                  American national identity historically and the Latine
                  communities’ growing interest in these collections.

                  In 2019, the Walters Art Museum invited a number of ancient
                  Americas curators from US art museums, who were in different
                  phases of reinstallation, to workshop ideas and/or report on
                  their approaches. The success of those conversations resulted
                  in the 2023 symposium at the Denver Art Museum. All symposium
                  participants hold or have held positions in curatorial
                  departments in the museums whose history they describe. Thus,
                  their essays reflect both their knowledge of the field and
                  their specific institutional experiences. The organization of
                  the essays follows both a chronological and geographic arc
                  beginning with Nancy Rosoff’s saga of the Brooklyn Museum’s
                  diverse holdings and ending with Kristopher Driggers’s history
                  of the Tucson Museum of Art’s collection. Mary Miller provides
                  a coda of sorts, exploring the business ventures of gallerist
                  Earl Stendahl and his family, which impacted so many of the
                  collections discussed here. While not all of the most
                  important collections of ancient American material in the
                  United States are represented within this volume, including
                  those at LACMA, the de Young Museum, the Detroit Institute of
                  Art, and the Dallas Museum of Art, the histories detailed here
                  represent a substantial overview of the evolution of the field
                  itself and collecting practices. Additionally, tracing the
                  shifting position of the ancient Americas within US art
                  museums offers crucial insights into museums’ own existential
                  struggles as we come to terms with our colonial histories and
                  make room for other perspectives and voices.

                  If museums are memory institutions, the keepers of national,
                  cultural, and even global histories, curators are carriers of
                  living memory for those institutions, communicating published
                  and unspoken norms and standards that have shifted radically
                  over the past few decades. In a specialty that has such a
                  short history, retirement or death means the loss of ephemeral
                  knowledge, memories about collection histories, donors, and
                  the vicissitudes of institutional histories. The recent losses
                  of pioneering curators Julie Jones at The Met, in 2021, and
                  Diana Fane at the Brooklyn Museum, in 2024, made the need to
                  capture the histories of these collections, remembered and
                  known by the current generation of curators, all the more
                  pressing. Jones began at the Museum of Primitive Art (MPA) in
                  1960 as an intern and was eventually promoted to curator in
                  1974. After the MPA collection was given to The Met, she
                  stayed with the collection and shepherded its transition,
                  overseeing the building and installation of the Rockefeller
                  Wing, which opened in 1982. Fane was one of the first
                  professionally trained curators in pre-Columbian art history,
                  having received her doctorate from Columbia University. After
                  working for three years at The Met with Jones, she began her
                  career at the Brooklyn Museum in 1979 and served there
                  twenty-one years before retiring. With their passing, the
                  field has been deprived of a fuller accounting of their
                  memories and wisdom and their perspective on the field’s
                  origins and evolution. They were the last generation to have
                  personal reminiscences of the field’s earliest influencers—the
                  first professional scholars and dealers in this field, such as
                  Gordon Ekholm, Junius Bird, and John Wise. This volume
                  represents our attempt to reconstruct and preserve the
                  memories of these collections and honor the work of those who
                  came before us. May the book provide a pathway forward for the
                  next generation.

                        Today, Mexican academics and institutions refer to
                        contemporary Indigenous communities as
                        <em>pueblos originarios</em>, or original peoples, a
                        term akin Canada’s “First Nations.” For a longer
                        discussion of the term, see Itzel Vargas Plata, “Los
                        Huecos del agua: arte actual de los pueblos
                        originarios,” in
                        <em>Los Huecos del agua: arte actual de los pueblos
                          originarios</em>
                        (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, 2021).
                        Similarly, some American institutions have adopted the
                        term “Ancestral Americas” to connect these collections
                        to present-day peoples. See Diana Magaloni, Davide
                        Dominici, and Alyce de Carteret, eds.,
                        <em>We Live in Painting: The Nature of Color in
                          Mesoamerican Art</em>
                        (Los Angeles County Museum of Art and DelMonico Books,
                        2024). The term “ancestral” blurs the temporal division
                        that the term “ancient” underscores: the ancient past as
                        separate from the present. Furthermore, it can serve as
                        a more inclusive term that welcomes descendant
                        communities on both sides of the border who cannot trace
                        a direct line back to their Indigenous ancestors.

                        departmental umbrella, but they maintain specialized
                        curators.

                        even in 2024, is not a complete one. While many ancient
                        American works are now in art museums, others remain in
                        natural history or anthropological institutions,
                        including the American Museum of Natural History (New
                        York), National Museum of Natural History (Washington,
                        DC), Field Museum (Chicago), and Natural History Museum
                        of Los Angeles County, among others.

                        entirely disconnected from the ground floor collections.
                        Furthermore, the objects presented on the second floor
                        were “employed as accessories for posed mannequins

                  The Brooklyn Museum began actively collecting the ancient arts
                  of the Americas in 1929 with the appointment of Herbert Joseph
                  Spinden (1879–1967), who succeeded Stewart Culin (1858–1929)
                  as the institution’s second Curator of Ethnology (fig. 1). The
                  four case studies presented in this essay foreground Spinden’s
                  central role in the acquisition of some of the institution’s
                  most iconic works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn1" id="page-rosoff-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Before coming to the Brooklyn Museum, Spinden was already well
                  known for his pioneering work on ancient Maya art and held
                  curatorial positions at the American Museum of Natural
                  History, Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and
                  Ethnology, and the Buffalo Museum of Science. Born in Huron,
                  South Dakota, in 1879, Spinden studied anthropology and
                  archaeology at Harvard University, culminating in a PhD in
                  1909.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn2" id="page-rosoff-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Upon his arrival at Brooklyn, he reinstalled Culin’s Rainbow
                  House Gallery of Ethnology and commenced building the museum’s
                  collection of prehispanic, Spanish American, and ethnographic
                  objects from Mexico and Central and South America (fig. 2).
                  Despite being an archaeologist, Spinden focused on the
                  aesthetic qualities of Indigenous art and called for the
                  desegregation of museum categories such as ethnology and fine
                  and decorative arts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn3" id="page-rosoff-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  He rejected the word “primitive,” insisting that prehispanic
                  traditions such as Andean weaving and Maya monumental
                  architecture were superlative art forms.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn4" id="page-rosoff-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  From 1931 until his retirement in 1950, he acquired almost
                  eleven thousand works for the museum and went on at least
                  seven collecting expeditions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn5" id="page-rosoff-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                  The first case study highlights one of the earliest
                  collections of prehispanic works in the United States.
                  Initially owned by the New-York Historical Society (now the
                  New York Historical) in New York City, the collection was a
                  product of donations from antiquities collectors during the
                  first half of the nineteenth century and consisted of
                  approximately 385 works from Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua,
                  Panama, Peru, and the United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn6" id="page-rosoff-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1936, the New-York Historical Society began an expansion of
                  its Central Park West building. Philip Youtz (1895–1972), the
                  director of the Brooklyn Museum, and Alexander J. Wall
                  (1884–1944), the society’s librarian, were in frequent
                  communication about the society’s need for temporary storage
                  of its Egyptian, prehispanic, Native American, and Assyrian
                  relief collections. Youtz, a trained architect, was appointed
                  assistant director in 1933 and full director in 1934. During
                  his brief tenure (through 1938), he initiated sweeping
                  changes, such as removing the building’s deteriorating front
                  stairs, creating an entrance hall, and reorganizing and
                  reinstalling the galleries with a new focus on cultural
                  history and the social and industrial implications of art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn7" id="page-rosoff-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Youtz introduced to Wall the idea of a loan in May 1936, and
                  Wall was receptive, acknowledging that there was no space in
                  the new building’s plans for these collections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn8" id="page-rosoff-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>

                  Youtz asked Spinden to examine the society’s prehispanic
                  collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn9" id="page-rosoff-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Spinden may have been familiar with some works, especially if
                  he saw the Huastec sculptures on display at the society’s
                  previous location on Second Avenue and 11th Street (fig.

                  Given the breadth and quality of the collection, Spinden was
                  likely enthusiastic. In January 1937, the agreement was
                  finalized, and the collections, with their display cases, were
                  transferred to the Brooklyn Museum and installed in the
                  galleries (fig. 4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn11" id="page-rosoff-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  As part of the loan agreement, museum curators were required
                  to submit biannual reports. In December 1938, Spinden wrote,
                  “All of the large and important Mexican sculptures have been
                  placed on exhibition, as well as the pottery from Campeche,
                  Tampico, etc. collected by B. M. Norman; also a cylindrical
                  Maya vase with painted design, a tripod bowl from the
                  highlands of Guatemala . . . and several of the finer examples

                  Collector Benjamin Moore Norman (1809–1860) grew up in Hudson,
                  New York, and took over his family’s bookstore after his
                  father’s death. He eventually settled in New Orleans,
                  Louisiana, in 1837, where he opened a bookstore on Camp
                  Street. Inspired by the success of John Lloyd Stephens’s 1841
                  book,
                  <em>Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and
                    Yucatán</em>, Norman decided to travel to the Yucatan in 1842.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn13" id="page-rosoff-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  During the four-month expedition, he visited archaeological
                  sites and towns and later documented his travels in the book
                  <em>Rambles in Yucatan</em>, published in 1843.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn14" id="page-rosoff-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Norman illustrated the travelog with his own drawings,
                  including sketches of twenty Maya ceramic figurines and
                  vessels collected during the trip (figs. 5 and 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn15" id="page-rosoff-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>

                  Norman acquired the Maya Jaina figurines from the Camacho
                  brothers, Presbyterian priests who lived in the port town of
                  Campeche.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn16" id="page-rosoff-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Leandro (1792–1849) and José María (1796–1854) Camacho were
                  passionate collectors and established what may have been the
                  first museum in the republic of Mexico to house their vast and
                  eclectic collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn17" id="page-rosoff-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Norman’s second expedition to Mexico occurred in 1844 and
                  lasted a little over four months. He documented the trip in
                  another travelog, titled
                  <em>Rambles by Land and Water, or Notes of Travel in Cuba and
                    Mexico</em>, which was published in 1845. After a few weeks in Cuba,
                  Norman traveled to Mexico’s Gulf Coast, arriving in the port
                  city of Veracruz. He then traveled north by boat up the Pánuco
                  River to the town of Tampico in the state of Tamaulipas.
                  There, he met Franklin Chase (1807–ca. 1893), the US Consul of
                  Tampico, and his wife, Ann (1809–1874).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn19" id="page-rosoff-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  The three became friends, with Ann Chase even nursing Norman
                  back to health when he had malaria at the end of the
                  expedition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn20" id="page-rosoff-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Norman’s explorations around the Pánuco River were productive.
                  There, he collected his first Huastec sculpture: a human face
                  carved in relief on an irregular stone block from the site of
                  Rancho de las Piedras (fig. 7). In addition, he collected two
                  small ceramic vessels at Cerro Chacuaco, near the town Pánuco,
                  and several ceramic figurine fragments in the countryside
                  around the Tamesí River.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn21" id="page-rosoff-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>

                  Norman also procured three monumental Huastec stone
                  sculptures: a Ritual Vessel (<a href="#page-https-www-brooklynmuseum-org-opencollection-objects-118926" target="_blank">37.2896PA</a>), a Standing Male Figure (<a href="#page-https-www-brooklynmuseum-org-opencollection-objects-118928" target="_blank">37.2898PA</a>), and the Apotheosis or Life-Death Figure—considered the
                  most complex and exquisite Huastec sculpture outside of Mexico
                  (fig. 8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn22" id="page-rosoff-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  It is likely that, while he was recovering from malaria in
                  Tampico, Ann Chase coordinated the acquisition. Though the
                  exact timeline is unclear, we know she was the source because
                  of an undated document titled “The Idols” that, while
                  unsigned, was likely authored by Norman. It reads: “Those
                  interesting relics were discovered several years ago by an
                  American, whilst exploring the Country of the Sierra Madre,
                  near San Vicente, State of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Much labor
                  was required before they could be cleared away from the ruins
                  under which they were buried. They were brought away from the
                  mountains on wooden sleds to the river San Juan, from thence
                  to the river Pánuco, in canoes, down to the town of Tampico,
                  and were presented to B. M. Norman by Mrs. Ann Chase.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn23" id="page-rosoff-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  The effort of unearthing and transporting three sculptures
                  weighing approximately one thousand pounds through jungle,
                  down two rivers, and across the sea to New York was a
                  monumental undertaking in 1844. <span class="mark"></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Surprisingly, the New-York Historical Society’s record of the
                  1844 donation only includes the items collected by Norman
                  himself and not the sculptures gifted to him by Ann Chase.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn24" id="page-rosoff-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Spinden speculated that they may have been transported on a
                  different ship and reached New York City too late to be
                  included in the society’s proceedings, however, they are not
                  recorded in any subsequent acquisition records.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn25" id="page-rosoff-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>

                  The Brooklyn Museum’s loan arrangement with the society went
                  smoothly for twelve years until June 1949, when the society
                  informed the museum that the American Museum of Natural
                  History (AMNH) had made an offer to purchase the three Huastec
                  sculptures and a Maya vase.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn26" id="page-rosoff-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  An alarmed Spinden warned of the proposal’s dire consequences,
                  “Let me be frank in stating my considered opinion: if we fail
                  to obtain these pieces we will never find their like again . .
                  . [and] we will lose by far the finest original pieces in our

                  The museum’s Governing Committee was swayed by Spinden’s pleas
                  and approved the purchase of the Society’s entire prehispanic
                  collection in 1950.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn28" id="page-rosoff-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>

                  Spinden’s commitment to building the ancient Americas
                  collection is exemplified by the second case study involving a
                  large collection of Costa Rican antiquities. In 1931, two
                  years after her husband’s death, Cristina Castro Keith
                  (1861–1944) contacted the Brooklyn Museum to donate over nine
                  hundred prehispanic works in memory of her husband, Minor
                  Cooper Keith (fig. 9). Spinden made an appointment to see the
                  collection in her Babylon, Long Island, home. Immediately
                  impressed, the following day he wrote to a moving company to
                  arrange the packing and transport of the donation to the

                  Born in Brooklyn in 1848, Minor Keith made his fortune in
                  Costa Rica during the last quarter of the nineteenth century,
                  first by constructing a rail line from the Caribbean coast to
                  the capital of San José and then as the country’s first
                  producer and exporter of bananas on a commercial scale. He was
                  cofounder of the United Fruit Company, which covered the Costa
                  Rican countryside with plantations, later expanding into other
                  Central American countries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn30" id="page-rosoff-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Keith introduced bananas to the American diet, using the new
                  railroad to transport them from inland plantations to the
                  coast for export. His financial success was solidified when he
                  married Cristina Castro Fernandez, the daughter of a former
                  Costa Rican president, in 1883.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn31" id="page-rosoff-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keith caught the archaeology bug when an uprooted tree on his
                  Las Mercedes plantation exposed over thirty gold ornaments
                  that had been deposited in a burial around 500 to 1,200 years
                  ago.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn32" id="page-rosoff-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  From that moment on, he employed a crew of excavators at Las
                  Mercedes and other ancient sites disturbed by his many
                  environmentally destructive, land-clearing projects.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn33" id="page-rosoff-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  During more than twenty-five years in Costa Rica, Keith
                  amassed a collection of over sixteen thousand objects, which
                  he gradually brought to the United States and kept in his Long
                  Island home.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn34" id="page-rosoff-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  The carefully cataloged, but poorly documented, collection
                  came primarily from Limón province on the Caribbean coast,
                  particularly around the site of Mercedes and the Las Mercedes
                  plantation, but Keith also purchased smaller collections from
                  the central highlands, the southern area near the Panama
                  border, and the northwestern region of the Nicoya
                  peninsula.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn35" id="page-rosoff-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  In 1882, he began making donations to US museums, and in 1914,
                  he placed about seven thousand objects on long-term loan to
                  the AMNH, where Spinden was an assistant curator. At the time,
                  Spinden wrote that the collection was unrivaled in its beauty
                  and richness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn36" id="page-rosoff-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                  The 908 works donated to the Brooklyn Museum in 1931 included
                  prehispanic pottery, carved stone sculptures, metates, and
                  tools (fig. 10).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn37" id="page-rosoff-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  More objects from Keith’s collection would soon follow. In
                  1934, the administrators of Keith’s estate decided to sell the
                  entire collection that was on loan to AMNH. The enterprising
                  American art dealer John Wise (1901–1981) bought the
                  collection and negotiated with AMNH and Brooklyn to split it
                  in half. Brooklyn Museum director Philip Youtz handled the
                  negotiations with Wise. Contracts specified that George
                  Vaillant of AMNH and Spinden, now at the Brooklyn Museum,
                  would take turns selecting single objects until the whole
                  collection was equally divided—about 3,500 items per
                  institution (fig. 11).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn38" id="page-rosoff-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>

                  The Brooklyn Museum’s iconic Nasca mantle, also known as “The
                  Paracas Textile,” presents an interesting third case study
                  because its itinerant history intersects with several
                  prominent individuals and illustrates the influence of
                  prehispanic art on modernism in the 1920s and ’30s (fig. 12).

                  The textile, renowned for the ninety needle-knitted figures
                  around its border, was discovered sometime before 1924 by the
                  <em>huaquero</em>, or grave robber, Juan Quintana at the
                  Paracas cemetery of Cabeza Larga in southern Peru.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn39" id="page-rosoff-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Quintana sold the mantle to collector Domingo Canepa, a
                  grocery store owner in Pisco.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn40" id="page-rosoff-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  French scholar Jean Levillier (1893–?) examined the textile
                  when Canepa’s archaeological collection was in Lima around
                  1924 and published the first detailed description in 1928.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn41" id="page-rosoff-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  Elena Izcue (1889–1970), a Peruvian artist and future textile
                  designer, illustrated the book’s frontispiece and produced two
                  detailed watercolors of the border figures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn42" id="page-rosoff-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  In her publication, Levillier reported that the mantle was one
                  of three textiles found in a mummy bundle of an old man whose
                  head was adorned with gold ornaments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn43" id="page-rosoff-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  Canepa had brought his collection to Lima in the hope of
                  selling it to the Museo de Arqueología Peruana, but the
                  director, Julio Tello (1880–1947), decided against it, even
                  though he acknowledged that the textile was “the gem of the
                  collection.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn44" id="page-rosoff-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  Tello, instead, recommended that Rafael Larco Herrera
                  (1872–1956), a Peruvian politician, businessman, and
                  philanthropist, purchase it for his museum at Hacienda Chiclín
                  near Trujillo, which he did sometime after 1926.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn45" id="page-rosoff-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>

                  In the 1910s, Izcue was teaching drawing in Lima’s schools and
                  had begun incorporating ancient Nasca pottery motifs into her
                  graphic designs for art-school textbooks (fig. 13).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn46" id="page-rosoff-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  She and Larco Herrera met in 1921 and bonded over their shared
                  interest in Peruvian archaeology and prehispanic art, which
                  they viewed as central to the country’s national identity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn47" id="page-rosoff-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>

                  her win a two-year, government-sponsored fellowship in Europe.

                  Remaining there for ten years, the Izcue sisters established a
                  successful business of hand-printing contemporary fabrics with
                  prehispanic motifs that were used for garments and
                  accessories. Sometime after 1927, Larco Herrera sent the Nasca
                  textile to Paris, where it was placed on loan to the Museum of
                  Decorative Arts in the Marsan Pavilion of the Louvre. It was
                  possibly at this time that Elena Izcue designed a fabric
                  pattern reproducing the abstract faces of the mantle’s
                  interior panel (fig. 14).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn49" id="page-rosoff-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>

                  During a 1935 visit to Paris, the American philanthropist Anne
                  Morgan (1873–1952) became enamored with the Izcues’ fabrics
                  and designs. She invited the sisters to show their work, in a
                  special exhibition in New York’s Fuller Building on East 57th
                  Street in December of that year. Planning began the month
                  before, and it was decided to display the Izcues’ modern
                  designs in conversation with ancient Andean textiles and
                  pottery. Two exhibition committee members, M. D. C. Crawford
                  (1883–1949), a textile scholar and editor of
                  <em>Women’s Wear Daily</em>, and Philip Ainsworth Means
                  (1892–1944), an anthropologist specializing in the ancient
                  Andes, played prominent roles, selecting loans that included
                  six Paracas and Nasca textiles from the Brooklyn Museum’s
                  collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn50" id="page-rosoff-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Crawford appealed to Youtz, writing, “My personal vanity is
                  largely engaged in this project. I want the Brooklyn Museum,
                  of which I regard myself as a part, to be adequately
                  represented. . . . [I]n reading over the memorandum from Paris
                  of the documents that are to be sent to this exhibition, I
                  find that they are going to include, among others, the Paracas
                  shawl which is, in my judgment, the greatest textile in the
                  world. Therefore, I want the exhibits from the Brooklyn Museum
                  to be [of] the highest distinction.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn51" id="page-rosoff-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  Crawford’s persuasion worked, and Spinden and Youtz approved
                  the loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1935, Larco Herrera sent the Nasca mantle to New York for
                  inclusion in the Izcue exhibition. The sisters transported it
                  themselves from Paris, and Larco Herrera sent an additional
                  twelve textiles from his museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn52" id="page-rosoff-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  After the exhibition closed, Means convinced Larco Herrera to
                  lend the mantle to the Brooklyn Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn53" id="page-rosoff-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  The spontaneity of the loan is indicated by a hastily
                  handwritten note from Means to Spinden stating that he had the
                  textile in his charge and was delivering it to the museum on
                  December 19, the day after the exhibition closed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn54" id="page-rosoff-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  Spinden likely put it immediately on display in the recently
                  renovated ancient Americas galleries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn55" id="page-rosoff-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1937, Larco Herrera recalled the loan so the mantle could
                  be exhibited in the Peruvian pavilion at the International
                  Exposition of Art and Technology in Modern Life, held in
                  Paris’s Trocadero Museum from May to November of that year.
                  Elena Izcue was commissioned to design the pavilion, and Larco
                  Herrera shipped the textile to her in Paris.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn56" id="page-rosoff-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  While the textile was on display, negotiations regarding its
                  purchase began between Rafael Larco Hoyle (1901–1966), Larco
                  Herrera’s son and director of the Larco Museum, and the
                  Brooklyn Museum’s director. Larco Hoyle instructed Izcue to
                  ship the textile back to Brooklyn at Youtz’s request, so it
                  could be examined by the museum’s Governing Committee. Letters
                  went back and forth negotiating the price. In one, Larco Hoyle
                  expressed ambivalence about selling such a rare piece to an
                  institution outside of Peru but conceded that he needed funds
                  to support his museum and archaeological work.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn57" id="page-rosoff-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  The textile returned to the Brooklyn Museum on December 23,
                  1937, and after months of fraught negotiations over the price,
                  which almost scuttled the sale, the mantle was finally
                  acquired on May 12, 1938.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn58" id="page-rosoff-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>

                <h2>
                  National Museum of Anthropology and History, Mexico City
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The last case study takes us back to Mexico with the
                  acquisition of forty-six prehispanic works in a 1948 exchange
                  with the Museo Nacional de Antropología e Historia in Mexico
                  City, hereafter referred to as the National Museum. The
                  transaction took over ten years to accomplish and was the
                  first of two collection exchanges between the
                  institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn59" id="page-rosoff-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The idea for an exchange was proposed in 1934 by Youtz, who
                  desired monumental prehispanic sculptures to “give us an
                  entrance hall that was unique” and would appeal to
                  visitors.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn60" id="page-rosoff-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  Spinden began discussions with officials at the National
                  Museum in 1937 when he was in Mexico.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn61" id="page-rosoff-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  After a pause during World War II, Spinden returned to Mexico
                  in 1944 and resumed discussions with Eduardo Noguera
                  (1896–1977), the director of the National Museum, and Ignacio
                  Marquina (1888–1981), the director of the Instituto Nacional
                  de Antropología e Historia. The exchange was of interest to
                  both directors because they wanted to expand into other
                  collecting areas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn62" id="page-rosoff-fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  Due to his knowledge of Mexican archaeology, the artist Miguel
                  Covarrubias (1904–1957) served as an independent advisor on
                  the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In June 1945, Brooklyn Museum Assistant Curator Nathalie
                  Zimmern wrote to Covarrubias at the Barbizon-Plaza Hotel in
                  New York City, enclosing a list of Brooklyn objects he had
                  selected for the exchange.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn63" id="page-rosoff-fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>
                  Covarrubias also assisted in the selection of archaeological
                  material from the National Museum’s collection, provided
                  values for all objects proposed by both institutions to ensure
                  an equitable exchange, and served as a neutral, bilingual
                  liaison between both parties.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn64" id="page-rosoff-fnref64" class="footnote-ref-anchor">64</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In 1946, the new director of the National Museum, Daniel Rubín
                  de la Borbolla (1907–1990), and Brooklyn Museum’s new
                  director, Charles Nagel (1899–1992), corresponded regarding
                  conditions for the exchange. Rubín de la Borbolla included
                  photographs of the proposed National Museum objects except for
                  a group of Monte Albán funerary offerings that were recently
                  excavated by Alfonso Caso (1896–1970) and were still being
                  studied; these would be added later. He also wrote that the
                  National Museum accepted the objects offered by the Brooklyn
                  Museum but requested the addition of a Costa Rican stone stele
                  and a gold ornament either from Costa Rica or Panama.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn65" id="page-rosoff-fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                  Nagel responded that the museum’s Governing Committee approved
                  the conditions but requested that the period for making
                  changes be limited to six months. He added that he and the
                  Governing Committee were completely satisfied with the objects
                  proposed by the National Museum (fig. 15) and that if the
                  Brooklyn Museum’s offerings were acceptable, “I see no reason
                  why this mutually advantageous exchange cannot be put into
                  effect.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn66" id="page-rosoff-fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>
                  With Nagel’s letter in hand, Spinden immediately wrote to
                  Rubín de la Borbolla, emphasizing the rarity of the Costa
                  Rican stone stele and wondering if the Brooklyn Museum might
                  obtain a large exhibition-quality piece in exchange.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn67" id="page-rosoff-fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>
                  The Aztec Year Bundle, which did not appear on the preliminary
                  list, was likely added at this time (fig. 16).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rubín de la Borbolla agreed to the six-month period, approving
                  the exchange on March 4, 1947.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn68" id="page-rosoff-fnref68" class="footnote-ref-anchor">68</a></sup>
                  The remaining correspondence relates to packing and shipping
                  and final approval by Mexican President, Miguel Alemán Valdés.
                  On December 24, 1947, Spinden received a Western Union
                  telegram from Rubín de la Borbolla saying that the crates were
                  on their way, and on March 10, 1948, they arrived at the
                  museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn69" id="page-rosoff-fnref69" class="footnote-ref-anchor">69</a></sup>
                  After the Governing Committee approved the acquisition, Nagel
                  wrote to Covarrubias and Rubín de la Borbolla, expressing how
                  pleased the committee was and thanking Covarrubias for his
                  assistance.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn70" id="page-rosoff-fnref70" class="footnote-ref-anchor">70</a></sup>

                  The project represented a significant early exchange between
                  the National Museum and a foreign institution. In January
                  1948, Spinden celebrated with his Mexican partners at the
                  Brooklyn Museum and the international exchange was announced
                  in the spring 1948 <em>Brooklyn Museum Bulletin</em> (fig.
                  17).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-rosoff-fn71" id="page-rosoff-fnref71" class="footnote-ref-anchor">71</a></sup>
                  Spinden also organized a special exhibition
                  <em>What Cortés Saw in Mexico</em>, which opened in September
                  of that year and featured the new Aztec acquisitions (fig.
                  18). The completion of this transaction must have been truly
                  gratifying for Spinden, who was winding down his long and
                  productive career at the Brooklyn Museum.

                  The preceding case studies illustrate the diverse ways Spinden
                  acquired prehispanic works during the ’30s and ’40s. From
                  initiating purchases and courting donations to brokering
                  exchanges with peer institutions, he took advantage of every
                  opportunity to build the collection. His vanguard curatorial
                  practice of presenting anthropological and archaeological
                  collections as art put the Brooklyn Museum ahead of the curve
                  compared to other fine art museums. Finally, Spinden was a man
                  of his time who recognized the importance of the Pan-American
                  relationships he developed during frequent trips to Latin
                  America. His passionate advocacy of presenting prehispanic art
                  in an encyclopedic art museum promoted the understanding and
                  appreciation of the rich artistic traditions of the ancient
                  Americas in New York and the United States more broadly.

                <p>
                  With the return of peace after the dislocations of the US
                  Civil War, The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870
                  by businessmen, civic leaders, and artists in New York. Unlike
                  its European counterparts, the institution had no royal
                  collections on which to build and no dedicated space. Yet the
                  founders had noble, and ambitious, intentions: The Met was to
                  represent the world’s art history—of all periods and all
                  places. In 1880, the museum opened to the public at its
                  current site at 82nd Street and Fifth Avenue. The scene
                  described by Edith Wharton in her 1920 novel should be
                  imagined as being set shortly after this. Positioned on the
                  edge of Central Park, the museum was linked with other
                  currents of improvement in New York, including the park itself
                  (fig. 1). The museum grew quickly, as vastly increased wealth
                  of the economic elite in the city was translated into rapidly
                  expanding art collections, both private and public.

                  Nearly two thousand works of pre-Columbian art were acquired
                  as gifts and purchases by 1900, including gifts from the
                  Hudson River School painter Frederic Church, a trustee of the
                  museum and an enthusiastic early supporter of ancient American
                  art, and the purchase of a collection of Mexican antiquities
                  (and pseudo antiquities) from Luigi Petich, an Italian
                  diplomat.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn1" id="page-pillsbury-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Hailed in the nineteenth century as American antiquities for
                  an American museum, the pre-Columbian collection was seen as
                  essential to the young and still inchoate organization
                  establishing its institutional identity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn2" id="page-pillsbury-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Yet this interest waxed and waned, only to wax again by the
                  last quarter of the twentieth century.

                <p>
                  After a brief overview of The Met’s early presentation of
                  ancient American art and its subsequent reversal—the half
                  century in which the museum largely turned away from the
                  field—this essay addresses The Met’s later embrace of the arts
                  of ancient Latin America. The Met eventually returned to the
                  field in the belated wake of modernism, most impactfully via
                  Nelson A. Rockefeller and the 1969 transfer of the collections
                  of the Museum of Primitive Art to The Met. This essay focuses
                  largely on the period after 1914 and before 1969—a time when
                  The Met’s ambivalence about the place of ancient American art
                  within its walls reveals changing conceptions about what
                  constitutes the history of art and the place of ancient
                  American civilizations in world history.

                  The collection of “American antiquities” was initially
                  displayed in the basement hall of The Met’s first Central Park
                  building, alongside arms and armor and the collection of casts
                  and other reproductions, including photographs and copies of
                  Maya murals created by photographer-explorers Désiré Charnay
                  and Augustus Le Plongeon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn3" id="page-pillsbury-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  After the museum’s expansion in 1888 (see figure 1), the
                  pre-Columbian collection, which was to increase substantially
                  in the next decade, was moved upstairs, adjacent to the
                  paintings galleries and, later, musical instruments (fig.
                  2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn4" id="page-pillsbury-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  In the late nineteenth century, the museum visiting experience
                  was often a cold and dark one: The large gallery initially was
                  lit only by skylights—the museum was not yet electrified—and
                  dependent on inadequate steam heat. The sizeable number of
                  objects from the permanent collection was augmented by loans
                  on occasion, and the works were carefully mounted and laid out
                  by type (fig. 3).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn5" id="page-pillsbury-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  As John Taylor Johnson and Louis P. di Cesnola, the museum’s
                  first president and director, respectively, wrote in 1882,
                  appealing to the museum’s membership to establish a department
                  of “old American art”: “The history of the ancient American
                  civilizations can and will be recovered and read if we gather
                  and arrange in order their works of art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn6" id="page-pillsbury-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

Beneath those photos, the text reads: Petich’s old Mexican Collection has been pronounced by the foremost archaeologists, both American and from Europe, as the most startling one of its kind after the collection of the Museum in Mexico City. But notwithstanding its great value the ten Toltec Heads, which have been called the Mexican Tanagras, and whose exact copies in plaster we can now offer to the public, have been judged more valuable, more “absorbingly interesting” in themselves than all the other 1610 previous objects of which said collection is composed.  It would be impossible even to quote the many expressions of admiration that these heads have called forth from newspapers, reviews and scholars. After centuries of smiling at the skeletons of their masters under their native tumulus they were permitted to smile at the sons of a far later civilization, from the shelves of the Metropolitan Museum of Art to which the owner generously loans all such treasures." class="q-figure__image" src="_assets/images/figures/inline/pillsbury-fig-5.jpg" data-outputs-include="epub,pdf">

                  Assessments of the ancient American art at the time were often
                  quite positive. The guidebook to the museum’s collections
                  notes that “the accounts of the Spanish Conquerors as to the
                  high civilization of the old Peruvians find abundant
                  corroboration in these remains.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn7" id="page-pillsbury-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  The stars of the collection were what were then called “Toltec
                  Smiling Faces,” a type of sculpture that was largely unknown
                  until that time (figs. 4 and 5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn8" id="page-pillsbury-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Made in Veracruz in the seventh or eighth century in a style
                  now called Remojadas, these enigmatic figures would go on to
                  capture visitors’ imaginations for over a century.

                  Despite the initial interest in ancient American art, the
                  museum began to reconsider it in the second decade of the
                  twentieth century, as new leadership at the museum questioned
                  whether such objects belonged in an art museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn9" id="page-pillsbury-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  In 1914, most of the ancient American works were sent across
                  Central Park to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH),
                  losing their designation as “art” as part of that transition.
                  Some works, especially items of gold or silver, were retained
                  a bit longer, but those, too, were eventually sent on
                  long-term loan, this time to the Brooklyn Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn10" id="page-pillsbury-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>

                  There were some interesting exceptions to the mass relegation
                  of ancient American objects to other institutions, however.
                  Some twenty Maya and Mixtec items collected by the businessman
                  and philanthropist Heber R. Bishop remained in the museum
                  along with the Asian jades that formed the bulk of his
                  collection. Indeed, a reproduction of a Mixtec figurine in
                  that collection was reportedly one of the most popular items
                  in the museum’s book shop in the 1950s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn12" id="page-pillsbury-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Ancient Peruvian textiles, which The Met began to collect as
                  early as 1882, not only remained in the museum but continued
                  to be collected, at least sporadically. Following the model of
                  London’s South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert
                  Museum), The Met adopted a similar guiding principle that
                  museums could positively influence industrial design. The
                  garment business was New York’s largest industry; the creation
                  of The Met’s Textile Study Room in 1910 was fueled by the idea
                  that the study of the decorative arts would lead to better
                  design in factories and workshops (fig. 6).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The textile collection grew over the years, eventually
                  becoming the subject of a special exhibition in 1931, complete
                  with a catalog intended primarily for “students of ornament,”
                  a reminder of the abiding influence of Owen Jones, the
                  nineteenth-century architect, designer, and theorist, whose
                  sourcebook <em>The Grammar of Ornament</em> (1856) was
                  intended to make design principles in the decorative arts,
                  viewed globally, more widely available.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn13" id="page-pillsbury-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  By the 1950s, however, textiles were collected not simply for
                  study purposes but as works of art in their own right. As
                  modern art became more widely embraced, the path was laid for
                  seeing ancient Andean textiles in a new way. In 1959, John
                  Phillips, a curator in the Department of Renaissance and
                  Post-Renaissance Art who had worked on the 1931 exhibition,
                  recommended the purchase of eight Peruvian textiles. Perhaps
                  signaling a changing attitude at the museum, Phillips noted,
                  “In our day, when highly conventionalized forms have become
                  familiar through the agency of contemporary painting and
                  sculpture, these textiles seem far less <em>outré</em> than
                  they once did.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn14" id="page-pillsbury-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It should be noted, however, that The Met was hardly an early
                  adopter of what we now think of as modern art. Indeed, it is
                  important to bear in mind that the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)
                  was born in part out of frustrations with The Met’s obdurate
                  refusal to entertain contemporary art. Later in the century,
                  it would be MoMA, and its neighbor the Museum of Primitive
                  Art, that would mount important exhibitions of ancient
                  American art. One interesting aspect of this change was that
                  The Met’s move was strikingly at odds with some broader
                  currents in the United States at the time. While The Met
                  remained quiet for decades, other institutions, including the
                  Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the
                  Philadelphia Museum of Art, and even the National Gallery of
                  Art in Washington, DC, were doubling down on collecting and
                  exhibiting pre-Columbian art, if only, as was the case with
                  the National Gallery, for a limited time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn15" id="page-pillsbury-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By 1952, leadership at The Met began to think that perhaps it
                  had been a mistake to relegate its pre-Columbian collection to
                  other institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn16" id="page-pillsbury-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  The museum began to reenter the field largely through the
                  efforts of Dudley Easby Jr., who joined The Met after World
                  War II. He had previously worked with Nelson A. Rockefeller in
                  the Office of Inter-American Affairs, the US governmental
                  agency promoting hemispheric solidarity during the 1940s to
                  counter German and Italian propaganda in Latin America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn17" id="page-pillsbury-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  From his post as the museum’s General Counsel, Easby was a
                  tireless advocate for the return of ancient American art to
                  The Met. At the invitation of the museum, Elizabeth
                  Easby—Dudley’s wife and a noted scholar of ancient American
                  art—prepared a report of The Met’s holdings of pre-Columbian
                  art, “forgotten treasures” that by now had long been on loan
                  to the AMNH and the Brooklyn Museum and featured in
                  exhibitions and publications internationally.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn18" id="page-pillsbury-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>

                  The return of ancient American art to The Met progressed in
                  fits and starts, however. In 1954, the museum hosted an
                  exhibition of pre-Columbian gold organized by Dudley and
                  Elizabeth Easby, an exhibition also shown in Washington and
                  San Francisco (fig. 7).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn19" id="page-pillsbury-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  A gallery dedicated to “pre-Columbian” art was first suggested
                  in 1956, but in that same year, Easby noted emphatically in
                  correspondence that the museum was not exhibiting
                  pre-Columbian art and that it did not have plans to do so in
                  the future, perhaps in light of the imminent opening of the
                  Museum of Primitive Art (see below).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn20" id="page-pillsbury-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Yet, by 1962, the tide had definitively turned. With the
                  support of James Rorimer, the director, Easby orchestrated the
                  return of the Brooklyn loans and initiated a campaign of
                  acquisitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn21" id="page-pillsbury-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  These included select purchases of monumental stone works,
                  textiles, and the cultivation of specific collectors, such as
                  Nathan Cummings, who eventually divided his collection of
                  Peruvian ceramics between the Art Institute of Chicago and The
                  Met. A selection of works from his collection was shown at The
                  Met from 1964 until 1969 (fig. 8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn22" id="page-pillsbury-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  These works were nominally cared for by the American Wing at
                  this time, in what a curator in that department described as a
                  “weird marriage of American decorative arts with pre-Columbian
                  art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn23" id="page-pillsbury-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  The ancient American collection became a source of contention
                  within the museum, as American Wing curators were increasingly
                  resentful of having to accommodate hundreds of new works over
                  which they had no say.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Easby and Rorimer persisted, however. Beginning in 1966, they
                  persuaded Alice K. Bache to donate a significant portion of
                  her collection of ancient American art. Trained as a sculptor
                  and painter in New Orleans before moving to New York to study
                  philosophy, Bache stands out against the sea of male
                  collectors and other women who collected in conjunction with
                  spouses or other family members. She worked closely with
                  archaeologists at the AMNH, including Junius Bird and Gordon
                  Ekholm, who advised her on purchases. She gave and bequeathed
                  numerous works to the AMNH and the Museum of the American
                  Indian (now the National Museum of the American Indian), but
                  she reserved the most important objects for The Met. Primarily
                  works of art in gold, the Bache gifts were transformative for
                  the collection. Indeed, the fine quality of the works surely
                  paved the way for the museum’s trustees to consider returning
                  to the field in earnest. At this point, plans were underway

                  These plans were vastly expanded in 1969, however, when the
                  museum agreed to accept Nelson A. Rockefeller’s collection,
                  which included ancient American, Native American, African, and
                  Oceanic art—a grouping of disparate traditions by then
                  referred to under the rubric of “primitive art.” Appointed a
                  trustee of The Met in 1930, Rockefeller tried repeatedly over
                  the years to entice the museum to return to the field of
                  ancient American art. In 1939, he proposed that The Met join
                  with the AMNH to support archaeological expeditions in Latin
                  America to collect primitive art, a plan thwarted by Herbert
                  Winlock, The Met’s director at the time and an Egyptologist
                  determined not to let new interests distract the museum from
                  building up the Egyptian collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn25" id="page-pillsbury-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Continually rebuffed by The Met, Rockefeller turned to MoMA,
                  offering to establish a department of primitive art there in
                  1942.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn26" id="page-pillsbury-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  But Alfred H. Barr Jr., MoMA’s founding director, while happy
                  to host exhibitions of other-than-Western art, was adamant
                  that MoMA refrain from collecting in this area.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn27" id="page-pillsbury-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  With his plans rejected by both The Met and MoMA, Rockefeller
                  decided to create his own museum, following in the footsteps
                  of his mother, who, in similar circumstances, helped found
                  MoMA when The Met refused to collect or exhibit contemporary
                  art.

                  Rockefeller began planning the new institution dedicated to
                  the arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indigenous Americas in
                  the late 1940s with the assistance and advice of René
                  d’Harnoncourt, who would later become the director of MoMA.
                  The Museum of Primitive Art (MPA), as it became known, opened
                  to the public in 1957 in a Beaux-Arts townhouse adjacent to
                  Rockefeller’s boyhood home on 54th Street, directly across the
                  street from MoMA (fig. 9). There was a clear synergy between
                  MoMA and the MPA, not surprising given that the two museums
                  shared governance, projects, and support from the Rockefeller
                  family. The gray stone facade was left unchanged, but the
                  interiors were converted into simple, minimalist spaces. Still
                  smarting from The Met’s decision decades earlier to exclude
                  pre-Columbian art from its holdings, Rockefeller was
                  deliberate in defining the purview of the MPA as “the
                  important art forms not included in The Met’s cognizance of
                  the past.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn28" id="page-pillsbury-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The MPA’s foundation documents, prepared in 1954, stress that
                  the MPA’s acquisitions and exhibitions would be limited to
                  objects of artistic excellence and would in no way attempt to
                  be representative in terms of anthropology.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn29" id="page-pillsbury-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  Works were to be presented as <em>fine art</em>, displayed in
                  a manner that was resolutely <em>modern</em>. Most works were
                  on open display—not in cases—a decision that, while
                  aesthetically striking, proved problematic at times (see
                  below). In the foundation documents, the institution is called
                  the Museum of Indigenous Art, but by the time the museum
                  opened three years later it had become the Museum of Primitive
                  Art. Rockefeller only reluctantly changed the name—his Mexican
                  friends did not like the new name at all—but “Indigenous”
                  apparently created confusion. In one account, Rockefeller
                  noted that the institution got mixed up with a new museum of
                  contemporary craft; elsewhere he recalled that people confused
                  “Indigenous” with “indigent.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn30" id="page-pillsbury-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>

                  D’Harnoncourt was deeply influenced by a starkly modernist
                  installation of a 1935 MoMA exhibition on African art
                  initiated by Barr and organized by James Johnson Sweeney (see
                  Koontz, this volume). The exhibition was one of a series of
                  what Barr called “primitive” exhibitions at MoMA, encompassing
                  <em>American Sources of Modern Art</em> in 1933 (fig.
                  10)—which included works from The Met’s collection—as well as
                  <em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em> in 1940 and
                  <em>Ancient Art of the Andes</em> in 1954. Robert Goldwater, a
                  noted historian of modern art with a strong interest in
                  African sculpture, had also worked on the 1935 African
                  exhibition (fig. 11). Brought in to be the first director of
                  the MPA, Goldwater expanded his concept of “affinity” for
                  gallery installations: Objects should be grouped by visual
                  form, not necessarily by subject matter or locale. Goldwater
                  was unapologetic about the decontextualization of works in the
                  MPA installations: “To put any of the world’s art in a museum
                  is to take it out of its intended environment.” No matter the
                  source, works possess inherent qualities “of skill, of design,
                  of expressive form and concentrated emotion that make it
                  <em>art</em>”—that render it accessible.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn31" id="page-pillsbury-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  The goal was to make the installations inviting and relevant
                  to modern tastes and interests.

                  The MPA exhibitions, all relatively small in comparison with
                  those at MoMA, were similarly minimalist in character, with
                  limited didactic information. The exhibitions were minimalist
                  in security matters as well. Perhaps not surprisingly, a small
                  Olmec figure went missing at the time of the first exhibition
                  (fig. 12). The paperwork surrounding the theft is fascinating.
                  The letter from Goldwater to Rockefeller apprising him of the
                  incident described the theft as likely the work of a
                  “crackpot” who left a note with the words “American degenerate
                  religious figure,” conjuring the specter of idolatry.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn32" id="page-pillsbury-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  The initial security report, however, says something slightly
                  different. The note had been placed next to the gallery’s
                  thermostat, and in a label-like format said, “AMERICAN,
                  DECADENT, probully [<em>sic</em>] of religious significance,”
                  echoing the label of the Olmec figure. It seems like an almost
                  Dada-esque joke on the pretensions of museum displays of
                  other-than-Western art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn33" id="page-pillsbury-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>

It’s not the enigmatic “ancient smile” (really a half-smile) of Greek or early Christian sculpture, but a natural, delighted grin of pure glee—imperishably fresh and charming. What was so funny in 700 A.D.? We’ll never know. There wasn’t any threatening nuclear cloud—but there was war, famine, pestilence. Eventually, one or all of these obliterated the people and the culture that produced this little head.

                  publications in the early years were essentially elegant
                  checklists; it is only later that the exhibitions were
                  accompanied by serious scholarly contributions. Julie Jones,
                  the MPA’s first (and only) full-time curator for the arts of
                  the ancient Americas, produced
                  <em>The Art of Empire: The Inca of Peru</em> (1963); later,
                  working with Yale anthropologist Michael D. Coe, the museum
                  published
                  <em>The Jaguar’s Children: Pre-Classic Central Mexico</em>
                  (1965). These exhibitions were also the two most-attended
                  ancient American shows at the MPA.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn36" id="page-pillsbury-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  About half of the exhibitions at the MPA included works from
                  at least two, or usually all three, areas represented by the
                  museum. Of the single-area shows, a little over a third of the
                  exhibitions were dedicated to the arts of the ancient
                  Americas. In the later years, the idea was to have one show
                  from each area per year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the end, the MPA was open for seventeen years, during which
                  time the staff mounted some seventy exhibitions and published
                  nearly sixty books, catalogs, and gallery guides. By the late
                  1960s, however, the future of the MPA was in doubt.
                  Rockefeller’s son Michael, whom he had hoped would take over
                  as director, was lost on a collecting expedition in 1961. Some
                  four months after Michael’s death, d’Harnoncourt wrote to
                  Rockefeller about the future of the MPA, including questioning
                  who would be its director when Goldwater retired.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn37" id="page-pillsbury-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Some scholars have suggested that Rockefeller wanted to close
                  the MPA for financial reasons, and indeed, parts of the
                  collection were put up at auction in 1967, ten years after the
                  museum had opened.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn38" id="page-pillsbury-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  The African works fetched robust prices, but many of the
                  ancient American works sold for well less than their initial
                  purchase price.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn39" id="page-pillsbury-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  While Rockefeller had hoped the MPA would become more
                  self-sustaining financially, money was not the impetus for the
                  dissolution of the institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other factors influenced Rockefeller’s thinking. In 1966, he
                  was running for a third term as governor of New York, and he
                  was increasingly seen as too rich and too removed from the
                  average New Yorker. The optics of art collecting surely did
                  not help in the opinion polls. Public opinion about collecting
                  archaeological material was also beginning to shift in the
                  mid-sixties, and this surely had a significant impact on
                  Rockefeller’s decision. The MPA received a letter in May of
                  1966 informing them that the Department of State had received
                  a diplomatic note from the Guatemalan embassy regarding the
                  return of Piedras Negras Stela 5, a work purchased from a New
                  York gallery in 1963.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn40" id="page-pillsbury-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  The subject of the art market’s relationship to the
                  destruction of archaeological sites was becoming an
                  increasingly important topic of public debate, and it
                  undoubtedly had an impact on Rockefeller’s impulse to collect
                  antiquities from Latin America, especially in light of what he
                  considered to be his very close relationship with that region
                  of the world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn41" id="page-pillsbury-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>Moving Uptown</h2>
                <p>
                  The reasons for MPA’s closure were ultimately
                  overdetermined.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn42" id="page-pillsbury-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Whatever the reason, or reasons, by the mid-1960s, it was
                  clear to the staff that Rockefeller had run out of
                  enthusiasm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn43" id="page-pillsbury-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  In the spring of 1967, d’Harnoncourt, Rockefeller, and Thomas
                  Hoving, who became director of The Met in April of that year,
                  gathered at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue apartment to discuss a
                  transfer of the MPA to The Met.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn44" id="page-pillsbury-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  This was a moment when The Met, led by an energetic new
                  director, was embarking on a massive expansion, including the
                  construction of new wings to house the Temple of Dendur and
                  the Lehman Collection. The proposed Rockefeller Wing would
                  become the final major expansion. Although The Met had been
                  cautiously reentering the field of ancient American art under
                  the previous two directors, Francis Taylor and James Rorimer,
                  Hoving made the decisive move, and on a grand scale.

                  The agreement was signed in 1969, and the announcement of the
                  transfer was made at a preview of an exhibition of some one
                  thousand works from the MPA that year (fig. 14). A
                  considerable critical and popular success, the exhibition
                  received over 170,000 visitors: about half the number the MPA
                  received during its lifetime.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn45" id="page-pillsbury-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  Accompanied by a catalog and a <em>Bulletin</em>—the cover
                  graced by a Remojadas figure—the exhibition was one of three
                  celebrating Rockefeller’s gifts of art to major institutions,
                  including MoMA.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn46" id="page-pillsbury-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  Rockefeller had finally triumphed at The Met, some forty years
                  after he first attempted to persuade the museum to return to
                  the field of ancient American art. In the following year, the
                  MPA celebrated The Met’s own collection of ancient American
                  art—a collection almost completely ignored by the uptown
                  institution for over half a century (fig. 15).

                  Easby stepped down as The Met’s General Counsel to become
                  chair of the newly formed department in 1969. Already in ill
                  health, however, his retirement from that post (“on or before
                  January 1, 1971”) was agreed upon by Rockefeller and The Met
                  in August of 1969.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn47" id="page-pillsbury-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  Goldwater and Douglas Newton, an MPA curator who was to become
                  chair of the new department at The Met, moved uptown shortly
                  after the transfer was announced in 1969. The MPA closed in
                  1974, and the remaining staff—including Julie Jones—library,
                  and collections also moved uptown.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn48" id="page-pillsbury-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  Of the 1,731 of works of African, Oceanic, and ancient
                  American art that were accessioned by The Met in 1979 (the
                  year Rockefeller died), nearly one thousand were from the
                  Americas—largely, but not exclusively, of the pre-Columbian
                  era.

                  By the time the MPA moved uptown, however, The Met had been
                  engaging with ancient American art for nearly a decade. With
                  the help of Elizabeth Easby, a consultant at The Met for the
                  Nathan Cummings exhibition in 1964 and acting curator at the
                  Brooklyn Museum between 1965 and 1968, the museum organized
                  several small exhibitions in the 1960s, as well as
                  <em>Before Cortés: Sculpture of Middle America</em>, an
                  ambitious project that included some three hundred works and
                  was seen by over three hundred thousand visitors (fig. 16).
                  The exhibition was part of a recent agreement between the
                  museum and Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Antropología e
                  Historia to exchange loans, the beginning of the museum’s
                  attempt to reckon with the growing concerns about how the art
                  market’s demand for antiquities was destroying archaeological
                  sites in Latin America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn49" id="page-pillsbury-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>

                  The Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, named in memory of Nelson’s
                  son, opened on January 19, 1982, three years after Nelson
                  himself died. Nearly half a million people visited the wing in
                  its first year, and critical reception was largely
                  positive.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn50" id="page-pillsbury-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Covering some forty thousand square feet on the museum’s south
                  side, the wing mirrored the glass enclosure of the Temple of
                  Dendur on the museum’s north side. The inaugural installation
                  drew from the spare installation style of the MPA, albeit with
                  more works behind glass (fig. 17). The theatrical lighting,
                  however, was perhaps the most striking feature of the new
                  galleries. Finished in a uniform beige, the galleries had
                  little ambient light, making the spotlights on sculpture quite
                  dramatic (fig. 18). Julie Jones became the first fulltime
                  curator of this field at The Met, a post she continued to hold
                  for almost forty years.

                <h2>
                  Ancient American Art at The Met: The First Hundred Years
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Although we often slide past this fact, most museum
                  collections are formed more through start-and-stop processes
                  rather than slow-and-steady ones. But, even if we recognize
                  that, the history of The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s
                  engagement with the arts of the ancient Americas is marked,
                  perhaps more than most, by periods of enthusiastic embrace
                  followed by stunning rejections. Initially celebrated as
                  American antiquities for an American museum in the nineteenth
                  century, only to be largely expelled from the institution for
                  much of the twentieth, pre-Columbian art returned to The Met
                  as <em>modern</em> in the 1960s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pillsbury-fn51" id="page-pillsbury-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  The Met’s decision to reenter this field in the 1960s was
                  ultimately driven by multiple factors, including currents in
                  contemporary art and broader social issues, reminding us of
                  the complex interplay between specific individuals,
                  institutions, and shifting ideas about what is appropriate for
                  an American art museum.

                  As we embark on the first major renovation of the Michael C.
                  Rockefeller Wing in its forty-three-year history, my
                  cocurator, Laura Filloy Nadal, and I, along with our team,
                  continue to wrestle with this legacy. The place of works
                  created in the Americas prior to the European invasion within
                  museums continues to be the subject of debate. At the heart of
                  these debates is the question of what art <em>is</em>—in many
                  ways, a question that has been asked over the entire course of
                  The Met’s history. Do these objects belong in an art museum,
                  and if so, where? Increasingly, the debate centers on whether
                  these collections even belong in a museum, outside of the
                  lands in which they were made, a question that must also be
                  framed by a recognition of the rich constellations of cultural
                  heritage represented in New York’s social fabric. The Met’s
                  own history of ancient American art initially in, then out,
                  and then in again, as disconcerting as the history is at
                  times, should also serve as a reminder that museums are
                  living, evolving institutions, and that this capacity for
                  change should give us hope (fig. 19).

                        on an earlier report by “Miss Gash,” prepared in 1942,

                        Hoving exaggerated the success of the exhibition in
                        comparison to MPA visitorship at times, stating that The

                  In the present day, nearly every curator of ancient American
                  art in a US art museum has a strategic plan for their
                  exhibitions, for acquisitions, and perhaps for programming and
                  artist collaborations. Thoughtful collecting, display, and
                  interpretation, directed by curatorial staff knowledgeable
                  about their subject area, are hallmarks of twenty-first
                  century museums. But things were quite different just a few
                  decades ago. Many museums in the Mid-Atlantic region, like
                  their New York and Boston counterparts, began to be formed in
                  the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, a time when
                  both curatorial training and study of the ancient Americas
                  were in their infancy. This essay will show how collections at
                  the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore Museum of Art, and
                  Philadelphia Museum of Art were shaped, not by curatorial
                  concerns and strategy but by the actions of dealers, donors,
                  and directors. Even as the study and knowledge of the ancient
                  Americas expanded, few museums have had the luxury of
                  full-time, permanent curators trained in this area. Of the
                  institutions mentioned here, only the Walters has engaged a
                  full-time, permanent curator for its collection (the author of
                  this essay) and only in 2017. So, for decades, it was dealers,
                  donors, directors, as well as fellows, conservators,
                  registrars, and administrators who stepped in to help form,
                  expand, and interpret collections and to organize exhibitions
                  featuring art of the ancient Americas. Although this essay
                  discusses museums of the Mid-Atlantic region, the pattern of
                  other-than-curatorial administration can be extrapolated to a
                  range of other museums that could not be covered by the 2023
                  Mayer Center symposium and this volume.

                  The influential dealer George Kunz (1856–1932) encouraged
                  Henry Walters (1848–1951), the founder of the Walters Art
                  Museum, to buy a range of works from Tiffany &amp; Co., where
                  Kunz was the first gemologist.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn1" id="page-hoobler-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  While not a typical dealer with his own gallery, Kunz worked
                  in various facets of Tiffany’s business for decades, but his
                  role in marketing works of the ancient Americas, to Walters
                  and other collectors, is still little-known. Kunz is
                  recognized in this field only in connection with a jadeite
                  figure held by the American Museum of Natural History in New
                  York. One of the first works to be identified on a stylistic
                  basis as Olmec, it is still known as the

                <p>
                  Born in New York, Kunz became very interested in stones from a
                  young age, after a formative visit to the mineral specimens at
                  the Broadway Barnum Museum (fig. 1). Shortly after, he moved
                  with his family to Hoboken, New Jersey, and began forming
                  collections of the many rock types he was able to acquire
                  there. He eventually sold a collection of minerals to the
                  University of Minnesota, which gave him the confidence, at
                  just twenty years of age, to offer a tourmaline for sale to
                  Charles Louis Tiffany of Tiffany &amp; Co. jewelers. At that
                  time, only diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, along
                  with pearls, were typically used for jewelry. Kunz encouraged
                  Tiffany to market a broader range of gemstones to a growing
                  middle class. Tiffany hired him in 1876, and three years
                  later, at just twenty-three years old, he became the company’s
                  youngest vice president.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn3" id="page-hoobler-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                <p>
                  At Tiffany, Kunz was able to form close relationships with
                  many high-profile collectors of the period, such as J. P.
                  Morgan and the Walters family of Baltimore. The founding
                  patriarch was William Thompson Walters (1820–1894), but Kunz
                  was especially close to William’s son Henry (1848–1931) (fig.
                  2). The family amassed great fortunes in a number of
                  industries, particularly railroads. As Confederate
                  sympathizers, though, they left Baltimore during the Civil War
                  and lived in France where Henry was exposed to art from a
                  young age. Over his adult life, he would make enormous
                  additions to the modest collection begun by his father.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn4" id="page-hoobler-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is not known how the paths of Henry Walters and George Kunz
                  first intersected, but they certainly would have met by the
                  time that Walters attended the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair,
                  where he purchased items including at least one vase and a
                  ring from Tiffany.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn5" id="page-hoobler-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  As a plum marketing opportunity, it’s likely that Kunz would
                  have also been present at the firm’s pavilion there. And Henry
                  was not only a wealthy Baltimorean but maintained a residence
                  in New York and served on the Executive Committee of The
                  Metropolitan Museum of Art beginning in 1903, becoming a
                  second vice president there in 1913, a position he would hold
                  until his death in 1931.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn6" id="page-hoobler-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                <p>
                  While Henry Walters’s extensive patronage of Tiffany &amp; Co.
                  has been documented, less well known is that Walters also
                  bought about 120 works of ancient American art from Tiffany,
                  likely through Kunz’s efforts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn7" id="page-hoobler-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Unfortunately, none are as large or unusual as the Kunz axe,
                  but the mere fact that Walters was purchasing such works for
                  his own art collection was unusual for the time. Most of his
                  acquisitions were jades or gold works from Colombia or Central
                  America, objects that the gemologist acquired in his travels
                  in search of new semiprecious stones to be marketed to US
                  audiences. Kunz wrote about Colombian gold in an 1887 article
                  for <em>American Antiquarian</em> magazine, at least a decade
                  before Walters bought some of his first ancient American
                  works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn8" id="page-hoobler-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Walters’s first invoice from Tiffany for an ancient American
                  work dates to October 1897, for a single silver “Peruvian
                  chalice,” almost certainly
                  <a href="#page-https-art-thewalters-org-detail-14246-ceremonial-cup-with-faces-and-a-stylized-snake" target="_blank">WAM 57.977</a>, followed by six Colombian gold works in November (figs. 3
                  and 4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn9" id="page-hoobler-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  After his 1897 purchases, Walters’s collecting slowed down,
                  but in late 1910, he purchased from Tiffany five jadeite
                  pendants from Central America and sixty-seven gold ornaments,
                  which were shipped to his Baltimore home along with European
                  <em>objets d’art</em> and gems.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn10" id="page-hoobler-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  A letter of late 1910 from Tiffany clarified that these gold
                  works were from the Chiriquí region of Panama, on the Costa
                  Rican border.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn11" id="page-hoobler-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  In late 1911, Walters purchased an additional twenty-eight
                  gold works, said to be from Colombia.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn12" id="page-hoobler-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kunz and Tiffany’s connection to this material is important in
                  part because, although many museums are known to have Chiriquí
                  gold objects acquired around this time—the Museum of Fine
                  Arts, Boston, National Museum of Natural History, Heye
                  Foundation, Harvard’s Peabody Museum, and Yale University Art
                  Museum, as well as several non-US museums—no one has yet
                  traced their histories carefully to determine which of these
                  works may have originated with Kunz.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn13" id="page-hoobler-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In that same year, Walters bought two Mexica (Aztec) central
                  Mexican sculptures from the dealer Dikran Kelekian
                  (1868–1951), who had galleries in Paris and New York.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn14" id="page-hoobler-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  These are the only known ancient American works handled by
                  Kelekian, but it is likely that he moved to profit from
                  Walters’s interest. William Johnston, Walters’s curator
                  emeritus and biographer of the Walters family, asserts that
                  Walters’s curiosity was piqued by the French
                  <em>Exposition retrospective</em> in the Trocadéro in 1878, at
                  which “early Mexican terra cottas and sculptures captured the
                  public’s imagination and conjured up such concepts as the lost
                  content [<em>sic</em>] of Atlantis and prehistoric connections
                  between Europe and America.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn15" id="page-hoobler-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Johnston was probably correct in asserting that Walters’s
                  interest in Central American gold and jades lay largely in
                  their origins and craftsmanship as well as a desire to form a
                  universal survey collection similar to that of The
                  Metropolitan Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn16" id="page-hoobler-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  It is notable that during Walters’s term on The Met’s
                  Executive Committee, the museum sent its own ancient American
                  collections on long-term loan to the American Museum of
                  Natural History, issuing a message that such works were not
                  part of the “art” canon, as Joanne Pillsbury has noted.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn17" id="page-hoobler-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Yet, the two central Mexican stone statues purchased by Henry
                  Walters, and to a lesser extent the golden works from Tiffany,
                  continued to reverberate over the decades. The two stone works
                  depict a rattlesnake knotted into a ball (fig. 5) and a seated
                  figure with a tall, feathered headdress, likely the deity
                  Macuilxochitl. Both had been part of the storied Pingret
                  collection of ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn18" id="page-hoobler-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Both were also included in Pál Kelemen’s
                  <em>Medieval American Art</em> (originally published 1943), a
                  key source when there were few published resources,

                  The basalt rattlesnake became one of the museum’s most popular
                  objects. It was shown with gold works in the 1953 Walters
                  exhibition, <em>4000 Years of Modern Art</em>, which was
                  linked to the Museum of Modern Art exhibition,
                  <em>Timeless Aspects of Modern Art</em>. It was part of a
                  teaching portfolio of images chosen by curator René
                  d’Harnoncourt, which were said to be related to each other on
                  the basis of “affinity and resemblance” (fig. 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn20" id="page-hoobler-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  The snake was also lent to a 1968 exhibition on ancient and
                  modern Latin America at what was then the Isaac Delgado
                  Museum, later the New Orleans Museum of Art, and was part of a
                  1971–72 exhibition, <em>World of Wonder</em>, at the
                  Walters.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn21" id="page-hoobler-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>

                <p>
                  From these rather unprepossessing beginnings, the Walters Art
                  Museum’s ancient American collections and program were
                  revitalized in the early 200s by significant gifts and loans,
                  including a long-terms loan from the Stokes family of Nyack,
                  New York; and, particularly, by a large gift from John Gilbert
                  Bourne, given in 2009. The Walters engaged Matthew Robb (whose
                  chapter on the St. Louis Art Museum is included in this
                  volume) as a Visiting Assistant Curator between 2000 and 2003,
                  and Khristaan Villela was a Consulting Curator of Arts of the
                  Ancient Americas from 2010 to 2011. Conservator Julie
                  Lauffenburger also played an important role in maintaining a
                  focus on these works in the 2010s. I was hired as the first
                  permanent Curator of the Art of the Americas in 2017, and
                  dedicated galleries for the collection will open in 2025,
                  finally enshrining in the twenty-first century a part of the
                  collection that began to be formed in 1897.

                  The Walters’s history stands in stark contrast to the
                  situation at the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA), an institution
                  in the same city with strikingly different conditions. The
                  museum was formed by a range of individuals who came together
                  to form a municipal museum. The driving force behind the
                  collection was not a visionary dealer like Kunz, who created
                  enthusiasm for a new collecting area, but the patrons
                  themselves. While the director, Adelyn Breeskin (Acting
                  Director 1942–47, Director 1947–62), and Chief Curator
                  Gertrude Rosenthal, who worked at the BMA in various
                  capacities from 1945 to 1969, were helpful, the main impetus
                  for a major collection of ancient American art came from the
                  donors themselves and was part of a larger push for a diverse
                  “primitive” art collection at the museum, a common interest at
                  midcentury. Real estate investor Alan Wurtzburger (1900–1963)
                  and his wife, Janet (1908–1973), were the source of the BMA’s
                  most significant collection of primitive art (figs. 7–9).

                  Before it began seriously collecting primitive art, the BMA
                  presented several of the Pan-American exhibitions that were
                  circulated by the Office of Inter-American Affairs (OIAA) in
                  the 1940s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn22" id="page-hoobler-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  It is interesting that these exhibitions were designed with
                  broad audiences in mind—the 1944
                  <em>Art in the Countries South of Us</em> exhibition was held
                  in the Junior Museum of the BMA and included toys, although
                  the BMA <em>News</em> noted that this gallery, “though
                  designed to familiarize children with our Latin American
                  neighbors, will include material of general interest to adults
                  as well.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn23" id="page-hoobler-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  The 1944 exhibition paled in comparison, though, to the 1950
                  <em>Folk Arts of the South American Highlands</em> exhibition,
                  organized by the American Federation of Arts and shown at
                  several museums, including the Art Institute of Chicago. It
                  included about 160 works of ancient, colonial, and popular
                  arts from Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn24" id="page-hoobler-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  From the images available, this was clearly a lush and costly
                  show to mount, with mannequins in one corner and weavings on
                  backstrap looms on another pedestal (fig. 10).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, a 1952 exhibition featured a bequest of
                  approximately six hundred Native American works from Maryland
                  resident Florence Reese Winslow, who later lived in the US
                  Southwest. A <em>Baltimore Sun</em> article suggested that
                  Frederic Douglas, curator of Native arts at the Denver Art
                  Museum, and an important impetus in the founding of that
                  ancient Americas collection, simply happened to be in in
                  Baltimore when the bequest was announced and was immediately
                  pressed into service cataloging and classifying the works in
                  the gift. He is pictured in the <em>Sun</em> article
                  surrounded by dozens of baskets.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn25" id="page-hoobler-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Wurtzburgers’ gifts, then, bolstered and enhanced the
                  BMA’s forays into exhibiting and collecting primitive art. As
                  Frederick Lamp, former African art curator (1973–2004),
                  described it: “In 1953, Adelyn Breeskin . . . and . . .
                  Gertrude Rosenthal, were invited to lunch at Timberlane, the
                  Baltimore home of Alan and Janet Wurtzburger. Their meeting
                  was to result in the first significant formation of an African
                  collection at the museum, and the basis of the collection
                  today.” He continued, “At this luncheon [Alan] took Breeskin
                  and Rosenthal out to a separate lodge on the grounds, where he
                  showed them his new collection. They immediately decided to
                  mount a loan exhibition, which was produced in 1954 with a
                  catalogue introduced by Paul Wingert. A year later, the
                  Wurtzburgers donated the entire collection to the museum and
                  went on to begin other collections, first in Oceanic and then
                  in pre-Columbian art, with the express purpose of forming a
                  Wurtzburger Gallery of Primitive Arts at the BMA.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn26" id="page-hoobler-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  Lamp further recounted that the Wurtzburgers became interested
                  in collecting primitive art when they were enlisted by their
                  friend, the department store owner Stanley Marcus, to select
                  African works for him to purchase when they were on a trip to
                  South Africa in 1950.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the couple didn’t find anything for the Marcus
                  collection at that time, they were entranced by primitive art.
                  They became friends with Douglas Newton, the curator of
                  African art at the Museum of Primitive Art, who introduced
                  them to experts, including Paul Wingert and Douglas Fraser,
                  who were also influential in the formation of the collection
                  of New York’s Museum of Primitive Art. Yet even with this
                  guidance, according to former Native American arts curator at
                  the BMA Katharine Fernstrom (1987–2002), the couple
                  “restricted their collecting to purchases from other
                  collectors and art dealers, rather than collecting ‘in the
                  field,’ because they could obtain the best pieces from these
                  sources.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn27" id="page-hoobler-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After their gift of African art, by 1956 they had similarly
                  donated a collection of more than two hundred Oceanic works.
                  They also began purchasing Native American works: A 1956
                  profile asserted they were beginning their next collection in
                  Russia seeking to “uncover choice works of Pacific Northwest
                  Indian art collected by Russian seal hunters in Czarist
                  days.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn28" id="page-hoobler-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Yet, two years after the Oceanic gift, they then donated a
                  collection of ancient American art, which was accorded its own
                  catalog, with collection notes by Yale scholar George Kubler.
                  In that same year, 1958, the Oceanic and African collections
                  plus 105 works of ancient American art were among the
                  approximately five hundred works exhibited in a new permanent
                  primitive art gallery. At least one journalist asserted that
                  “it is the new pre-Columbian section of the gallery that
                  compels the greatest interest at the present moment. While
                  neither so extensive as the Oceanic section, nor so rich in
                  major objects as the African, it is of greater antiquity than
                  either and entirely unfamiliar to art lovers.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn29" id="page-hoobler-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>

                  Because of the breakneck speed of their collecting, the
                  Wurtzburgers were learning as they went. Their lack of
                  knowledge of and experience with much of the art, especially
                  the pre-Columbian works, meant that they had to depend heavily
                  on experts for guidance, and they bought from some of the most
                  established dealers of the era. Some works may have come from
                  Earl Stendahl on the West Coast, and one Zapotec effigy vessel

                  toward works that had been published or promoted as
                  particularly strong in quality. One small Mixtec or
                  postclassic maskette of stone that ultimately ended up in
                  Wurtzburger collection passed through the inventory of the
                  influential Pierre Matisse Gallery of New York (fig. 11). An
                  advertisement of 1939 shows it was offered for sale by Matisse
                  in the year leading up to the monumental
                  <em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em> exhibition at the
                  Museum of Modern Art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn30" id="page-hoobler-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Perhaps most importantly, like the Walters’ rattlesnake and
                  deity figure, it was published by Pál Kelemen in his
                  monumental <em>Medieval American Art</em> (1943),
                  demonstrating yet again how tightly woven is the web of
                  exhibitions, objects, publications, scholars, and dealers that
                  connect our different institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn31" id="page-hoobler-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Pierre Matisse was also instrumental in restarting the
                  collecting of ancient American works by another pair of
                  husband-and-wife collectors, Louise (1879–1953) and Walter
                  (1878–1954) Arensberg. Walter was the son of an owner of a
                  Pittsburgh steel crucible, and Louise was the daughter of a
                  family that owned textile mills in Massachusetts. Once
                  married, the couple lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then
                  moved to New York around 1911. They began collecting modern
                  art from the Boston iteration of the Armory Show in 1913, and
                  it quickly became a driving passion in their lives. While they
                  were buying works by French modernists and actively
                  participating in the creation of the New York Dada movement,
                  they also bought at least three pre-Columbian works from the
                  Mexican dealer Marius de Zayas during the 1910s while living
                  in New York.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn32" id="page-hoobler-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  But most of the almost five hundred ancient American works
                  were acquired after they moved to Los Angeles in 1921. Walter
                  Arensberg took his last trip to New York in 1937 and purchased
                  a red stone coiled serpent (<a href="#page-https-philamuseum-org-collection-object-51138" target="_blank">PMA 1950-134-215</a>) from Matisse, as well as a number of works from the Brummer
                  Gallery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn33" id="page-hoobler-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  The fact that Arensberg spent so much money on ancient
                  American works was either spurred or inspired by the Los
                  Angeles art dealer Earl Stendahl’s foray into this area;
                  around this time, he began selling works to the Arensbergs
                  almost weekly. I have previously written extensively about the
                  genesis and formation of the Arensbergs’ collection of ancient
                  American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn34" id="page-hoobler-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Here, I will focus on how their collection ultimately ended up
                  in the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA).

                  In 1940, the couple had agreed to donate their holdings to the
                  University of California, Los Angeles, as long as the
                  university’s museum created a new wing for them. When those
                  plans fell through, the gift was pulled. A few years later, in
                  1945, Katherine Kuh and Daniel Cotton Rich of the Art
                  Institute of Chicago visited. Kuh was a specialist in modern
                  Latin America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn35" id="page-hoobler-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  But Kuh and Rich drastically reduced the number of
                  pre-Columbian works that were to be shipped to Chicago for
                  exhibition in juxtaposition with their modern works. This
                  greatly irritated the Arensbergs, and they severed their
                  agreement with Chicago by 1946. A few years later, Fiske
                  Kimball, the director at the PMA, stepped in to seal the
                  deal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn36" id="page-hoobler-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                  Kimball and his wife, Marie, made several visits to the
                  Arensberg home and were in frequent contact with Sturgis
                  Ingersoll, president of the PMA’s board, to strategize how to
                  complete the gift (fig. 12). Marie Kimball and Louise
                  Arensberg seem to have formed a bond, and perhaps by 1950, the
                  Arensbergs, entering their seventies, were simply tired of
                  “shopping” the institutions that courted them. Although the
                  dissolution of the agreement with UCLA had been known for some
                  time, when the collection was to be shipped to Philadelphia,
                  it was apparently a surprise to the Los Angeles community, as
                  a 1951 newspaper cartoon illustrates (fig. 13). The
                  bespectacled East Coasters are shown carting off the small
                  Teotihuacan goddess (<a href="#page-https-philamuseum-org-collection-object-51191" target="_blank">PMA 1950-134-282</a>) the couple owned. Reporter Kenneth Ross lamented the loss
                  of the Arensbergs’ “two and a half million dollar collection
                  of pre-Columbian and Modern art which every major city in
                  America except LA asked for.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn37" id="page-hoobler-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  How, then, did Fiske Kimball succeed where Katharine Kuh and
                  Daniel Catton Rich failed? This story is one of triumph after
                  failure. Originally, the Arensbergs were quite insistent that
                  they wanted the fruits of all their lives’ labors to stay
                  together. Walter Arensberg, in particular, had three main
                  passions in life: modern artworks, particularly conceptual
                  ones made by Marcel Duchamp; ancient American sculpture,
                  especially large stone works of the Mexica; and proving that
                  Francis Bacon was the true author of the works commonly
                  attributed to Shakespeare. During his early attempts to find a
                  home for his art collection, Walter wanted all three parts of
                  the triumvirate to stay together in a given location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But by the time Kimball came to visit, Walter had been forced
                  to relax his standards. Although there were some early
                  discussions of merging the Francis Bacon Library, as his
                  research center was called, with the American Philosophical
                  Society in Philadelphia, these went nowhere, and the Bacon
                  Library ultimately stayed on the campus of the Claremont
                  Colleges near Los Angeles, while his art collections went
                  east.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn38" id="page-hoobler-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  As curator Matthew Affron has recently described in his
                  account of how some of the world’s greatest modern art was
                  gifted to the PMA between 1943 and 1950, landing the Arensberg
                  collection was a success for Kimball only after a series of
                  missteps. Kimball had organized large temporary exhibitions of
                  the Chester Dale and Alfred Stieglitz collections, which
                  ultimately went, in part or in whole, to other institutions,
                  so by about 1950, he was highly motivated in his wooing of the
                  couple.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn39" id="page-hoobler-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The PMA has had a complex construction history: A huge outer
                  shell opened in 1928, but only fifteen interior permanent
                  galleries were open to the public. Given that the Great
                  Depression began shortly after the exterior was complete, it
                  took decades to fully flesh out the permanent collections
                  necessary to fill the museum. However, the empty spaces meant
                  Kimball could be more nimble than other institutions in
                  expanding the collections. In the case of the Arensbergs,
                  Kimball used all his charm—and his drafting skills—to win
                  their collection for his museum.

                  The PMA archive holds a small drawing of the central hall of
                  the Arensberg galleries that Kimball promised the couple, with
                  Brancusi’s <em>Bench</em> sketched out, next to what appear to
                  be renderings of smaller Mexica deity figures and west Mexican
                  ceramics (fig. 14). In correspondence with his board chair,
                  Kimball revealed that his master stroke to seal the deal was
                  producing detailed sketches, including this drawing, planning
                  for “building your collection its dream house,” as Marie
                  explained to Louise. Kimball telegraphed his board chair in
                  excitement on February 7, 1949, when he succeeded in getting
                  Louise and Walter to initial this drawing, which they did at

                  Although it would take many more months to hammer out the
                  final details of the agreement, Kimball and the PMA did not
                  flinch from the challenges—or the shipping costs—of
                  transporting a collection that included a large-scale corn
                  goddess, a stone basin, and, particularly challenging, a

                  Kimball recognized the extraordinary power of these works,
                  particularly the calendar stone, and centered them in the
                  first exhibition of the Arensbergs’ collection, which included
                  only their ancient American collection. It was installed in
                  1953 in a small special exhibition space, not yet the
                  galleries that had been expressly designed for their
                  collection (fig. 15).

                  While the spacing and lack of casework in this exhibition can
                  be odd for twenty-first century tastes, Kimball and his
                  designers were guiding a pre-Columbian installation that felt
                  very streamlined and contemporary, even before the Arensbergs’
                  modern works were added. The tilted platform is echoed by
                  zigzag shelves, which seem to riff on the Mesoamerican
                  pyramidal form. Also, the stone works are displayed on
                  pedestals, consciously marking them as art. I have not found
                  information as to the paint scheme for this gallery, but color
                  blocks would have set off the gray and brown of stone and
                  ceramic objects, with physical blocks elevating them to
                  different heights. Unfortunately, we do not have the
                  Arensbergs’ thoughts on this exhibit, for they did not see it:
                  Louise died in November 1953 and Walter in January 1954.

                <p>
                  In 1954, once the Arensbergs’ modern works arrived at the
                  museum, Kimball put the masterworks of the collection, both
                  modern and pre-Columbian, into the central gallery that he had
                  sketched out five years earlier (fig. 16). The Teotihuacan
                  mural fragment, dominated by reds, must have been startling
                  against the white walls. In this gallery, there was an
                  equilibrium of ancient works, mostly stone, and the modern
                  paintings and sculpture, all enclosed within the grid and
                  arched spaces of the gallery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn42" id="page-hoobler-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Kimball really had created a “dream home” for the Arensberg
                  collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn43" id="page-hoobler-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, the PMA’s strategy of pairing ancient American
                  works with European modern paintings and sculpture resonated
                  with only the most cerebral visitors. Despite the PMA out
                  maneuvering the Art Institute of Chicago for the Arensbergs’
                  collection, the PMA ultimately abandoned the original vison.
                  The museum complied with its agreement to keep modern and
                  ancient art displayed together for twenty-five years, but then
                  it quietly removed much of the ancient American material from
                  view. Perhaps this had to do with an informal agreement with
                  the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and
                  Anthropology (Penn) that stipulated that the PMA would accept
                  gifts of Asian art, while Penn would be home to African,
                  Oceanic, and ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-hoobler-fn44" id="page-hoobler-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  Whatever the reason, there has never been a dedicated curator
                  who specializes in art of the ancient Americas. In recent
                  years, major works from the PMA’s ancient American holdings
                  have been on view, though, on loan to the Princeton Museum of
                  Art and Penn.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The three museums discussed here all have drastically
                  different origin stories: One founded by a single man heavily
                  influenced by a single dealer to showcase craftsmanship and
                  luxury materials; one formed in just two years by
                  husband-and-wife donors looking to complete their collection
                  to fill a gallery of “primitive” art; and one developed by a
                  director willing to accession and ship thousands of pounds of
                  stone to avoid losing out on a major collection of modern art.
                  The legacies of these collections have also developed
                  unevenly, but there is a growing sense that there is a
                  new-found relevance and import to these collections of ancient
                  American art. In the twenty-first century, the Latino
                  populations in both Philadelphia and Baltimore, as well as the
                  country as a whole, are growing quickly and are eager to see
                  their history and heritage represented in US museums. As
                  institutions seek to make heritage more accessible to
                  descendant communities, there likely will be dedicated
                  curators who have knowledge and expertise in ancient American
                  art to engage these communities. And many such communities may
                  be surprised that those collections do exist, for it was not
                  only large institutions and those in largely Latino cities
                  that amassed works of ancient American art. Smaller museums
                  and those outside the major cities for art (New York, Chicago,
                  and later the West Coast and Texas) were also essential to the
                  network of dealers, donors, and directors that connected them
                  to larger museums and larger trends in the history of
                  collecting. Still by lending works, by keeping dealers afloat
                  through (sometimes smaller) acquisitions, by offering venues
                  for traveling Pan-American exhibitions, by making avant-garde
                  installation design choices, and by making their collections
                  available for key early publications, such as Kelemen’s
                  <em>Medieval American Art</em>, these museums helped to
                  create, expand, and make viable the web of ancient American
                  art on public view at midcentury.

                        extremely helpful for understanding Kunz’s marketing of
                        ancient gold. He has been profiled in a number of
                        articles and on websites as being a ground-breaking
                        gemologist and not in his role art from the ancient
                        Americas.

                <p>
                  In 1920, four years after the Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA)
                  opened, its Board of Trustees resolved that it would display
                  “the art of primitive Americans, such as Peruvian, Mexican,
                  and North American Indian . . . which would be the first
                  attempt of an American museum to show in a constructive way
                  [that is, not as archaeological artifact] the art of those who
                  lived here before the white man came.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn1" id="page-bergh-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  The impetus for the resolution, unrealized until 1926,
                  probably stems in part from the background of its author,
                  Frederic A. Whiting (1873–1959), the museum’s first director
                  (fig. 1). Prior to his arrival in Cleveland, he had been
                  deeply involved in the Arts and Crafts movement in New
                  England, serving as secretary of Boston’s nationally
                  influential Society of Arts and Crafts for a dozen years,
                  among other things.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn2" id="page-bergh-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  The Arts and Crafts movement embraced handcraftsmanship and
                  precapitalist forms of society, such as those of the
                  aboriginal Americas, as antidotes to the impacts of
                  industrialization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn3" id="page-bergh-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  In line with these ideas, Whiting and at least some trustees
                  conceived of the museum’s collection above all else as an
                  educational resource for the immigrants who worked in the
                  industries that were a source of Cleveland’s
                  early-twentieth-century wealth.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn4" id="page-bergh-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is a measure of Whiting’s ambition in the field that in the
                  1920s he considered acquiring two ancient Andean collections,
                  one valued at a respectable $29,000 (today, over
                  $500,000).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn5" id="page-bergh-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  That acquisition had been recommended by Philip Ainsworth
                  Means (1892–1944), an Andean specialist and one of the many
                  archaeologists with whom the CMA would eventually consult
                  about authenticity and related matters. Neither purchase came
                  to fruition, however, and during the first few decades, the
                  collection consisted almost entirely of modest gifts from the
                  city’s prosperous citizens, among them the first of several
                  women who played strong roles in the formation of the museum’s
                  Indigenous American holdings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, Whiting’s greatest contribution to the field was not
                  building the collection but rather advocating for Indigenous
                  arts as worthy of an art museum’s attention. In 1929, in one
                  of his last acts before resigning, he named the art historian
                  and artist Charles F. Ramus (1902–1979) “In Charge of
                  Primitive Art,” a designation that bundled together and
                  singled out Indigenous American, African, and Oceanic arts
                  while falling short of a curatorial appointment. In doing so,
                  he was likely encouraged by Mary Gardiner Ford (d. 1959), a
                  museum supporter who in the same year created a fund dedicated
                  to the acquisition of primitive art, especially from the
                  ancient Americas, in memory of her late husband.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn6" id="page-bergh-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                  During Ramus’s brief employment (he resigned in early 1935),
                  he made the museum’s first nontextile ancient American
                  purchases—three bowls winnowed from a large group of Andean
                  (Nazca) ceramics offered by the Argentine dealer Mauro Enrique
                  Pando y Pomar.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn7" id="page-bergh-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  He also organized several temporary installations of primitive
                  art for both the general public and children, the latter
                  because, like some other early curators, he divided his time
                  with the Department of Educational Works (fig. 2). His efforts
                  in this vein included what may have been the museum’s first
                  ancient American exhibition based on loans,
                  <em>Comparative Pottery and Peruvian Textiles</em>, in
                  1931.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn8" id="page-bergh-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  It is worth noting here that in the early years, educators
                  played a strong role in promoting primitive arts in Cleveland,
                  especially after the hire of Thomas Munro (1897–1974), an
                  internationally noted aesthetic philosopher, as Curator of
                  Education in 1931.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn9" id="page-bergh-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  From the start, the department had its own funds to purchase
                  objects for use in public outreach programs, and the education
                  art collection, which includes Indigenous American arts,
                  eventually grew to be substantial.

                  In 1930, after Whiting’s departure, the trustees promoted
                  William M. Milliken (1889–1978), who had been hired as the
                  museum’s first decorative arts curator in 1919, to become its
                  second director (fig. 3). Like Whiting, Milliken had no formal
                  arts training, though he took art history courses during his
                  studies at Princeton University. It was through his experience
                  in museums—first on the curatorial staff of The Metropolitan
                  Museum of Art, where he worked with J. Pierpont Morgan’s
                  medieval collection, and then in Cleveland—that he developed
                  interests in the medieval and the French Gothic and Baroque
                  periods, distinguishing himself in acquisitions through his
                  taste for small, finely wrought objects made of precious
                  materials.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn10" id="page-bergh-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  During his directorship, he continued in his curatorial role,
                  apparently assuming responsibility for primitive arts after
                  Ramus departed. Though the Great Depression withered the
                  museum’s budget throughout the 1930s, Milliken went on in the
                  1940s and 1950s to amass the core of the CMA’s ancient
                  American collection. Crucially, he did not do so alone but
                  rather with the collaboration of an important trustee, Emery
                  May Holden Norweb (1895–1984), and the help of an ambitious
                  art dealer, John Wise (1901–1981).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn11" id="page-bergh-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                  Norweb was a member of Cleveland’s economic and social
                  aristocracy whose family, the Holdens, had been involved in
                  the museum as trustees from its inception (fig. 4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn12" id="page-bergh-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Following suit, she joined the Advisory Council in 1940 and
                  soon became a member of the board, serving as its sixth
                  president during the 1960s—the first of only two female board
                  leaders so far. She was undoubtedly aided in her
                  accomplishments on the board not only by her family ties but
                  also by her long experience as the wife of a diplomat, R.
                  Henry Norweb, who served in posts primarily in Latin America,
                  including ambassadorships in Peru and Cuba and lesser
                  positions in Mexico, Bolivia, and elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn13" id="page-bergh-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  It was in Chile, in 1930, that she recalled having started to
                  collect in the field, saying that her eyes “were opened to
                  pre-Columbian art, and people who were experts in the field
                  began to bring me things. It was a gorgeous opportunity
                  because no one was buying it then.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn14" id="page-bergh-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  The unnamed experts may have been some of the archaeologists
                  who, like Means, routinely conferred with collectors,
                  curators, and dealers at the time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn15" id="page-bergh-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Ten years later, in 1940, she began to make a series of gifts
                  that transformed the CMA’s collection and helped open the
                  ancient Americas as a collecting area.

                  The Norweb Collection of ancient American art comprises about
                  seventy objects, most from the Andes, a focus that continued
                  early interest in the region.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn16" id="page-bergh-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Among her gifts are a group of South Coast textiles that
                  remain anchors of the collection, including the magnificent
                  lower half of an early Nasca mantle regarded as the greatest
                  painted cloth to have survived from the region (fig. 5). These
                  textiles seem to have helped to convince the young director
                  that ancient American arts, which he had disparaged as
                  archaeological, possessed artistic merit.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn17" id="page-bergh-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  She also donated or contributed funds to purchase key objects
                  from Mesoamerica and the Isthmian region (fig. 6). It may be
                  that she acquired some of the works in her collection while
                  living in Latin America, though there seem to be no records
                  identifying them; she also purchased material in the United

                <p>
                  One of her US sources was John Wise, the Virginia-born,
                  Harvard-educated, New York–based stockbroker, who, having been
                  financially ruined in the crash of 1929, began selling family
                  heirlooms (fig. 7). He went on to become a major ancient
                  American arts dealer—the king of midcentury East Coast
                  dealers, in the words of Michael Coe, a contemporary and Yale
                  University anthropologist and curator.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn19" id="page-bergh-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  It seems that neither Milliken nor Norweb were acquainted with
                  Wise when, in 1939, he visited Cleveland and offered the
                  museum an Isthmian gold pendant that Milliken found
                  “extraordinary” (fig. 8). Lacking funds, Milliken contacted
                  Norweb, who agreed to purchase it for the museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn20" id="page-bergh-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Years later, Wise recalled this as his first sale of an
                  ancient American object to a museum dedicated to art and a
                  turning point in the appreciation of ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn21" id="page-bergh-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  The encounter seems to have begun a long friendship between
                  Milliken and Wise that Coe singles out for mention and is
                  discernible in the warm, joking correspondence preserved in
                  Milliken’s papers (fig. 9).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn22" id="page-bergh-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  During the period of Milliken’s stewardship, Wise was by far
                  the most common source of ancient American objects that
                  entered the collection, whether by direct purchases or as
                  gifts from donors or Wise himself.

                  public school system, she wished to create a memorial to her
                  late parents and originally considered focusing her attention
                  on objects of peninsular Spanish origin to do so. But she
                  turned instead to the ancient arts of the Spanish colonies,
                  one suspects with Milliken’s encouragement, and over two
                  decades donated forty-six works, about half of them Isthmian
                  gold ornaments but also others (fig. 10).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn23" id="page-bergh-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  Milliken thought that her donations came from her teacher’s
                  salary, but she may have had family money: In one five-year
                  period in the 1940s, her cash contributions for acquisitions
                  totaled at least $43,500 (well over $700,000 today). As this
                  implies, she regularly gave funds to the museum and allowed
                  Milliken to negotiate and finalize purchases on her behalf,
                  but she also bought directly—in both cases, usually from Wise,
                  when the source is recorded.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn24" id="page-bergh-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Her process for selecting objects is not known, but Milliken’s
                  guiding hand may be betrayed by her collection’s emphasis on
                  small-scale objects made of precious materials.

                  Aside from Norweb, several other trustees, two of them also
                  women, supported ancient American acquisitions during
                  Milliken’s years, though more episodically: Jane Taft Ingalls
                  (1874–1962), niece of William Howard Taft; Roberta Holden Bole
                  (1876–1950), Norweb’s aunt; and Leonard C. Hanna Jr.
                  (1889–1957), heir to a Great Lakes industrial fortune and by
                  far the museum’s most important donor. His collecting focused
                  on European art, but he was interested in the ancient Americas
                  and is said to have spent many hours in Wise’s gallery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn25" id="page-bergh-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Apart from acquisitions, Wise was also very involved with
                  <em>Art of the Americas,</em> an important exhibition,
                  discussed below, that Milliken organized in the mid-1940s.
                  Wise’s contributions included lending objects and donating
                  funds for an exhibition publication. Perhaps most notable from
                  today’s perspective, however, is the fact that he also stepped
                  in when, three months before the show opened, one of
                  Milliken’s brothers died suddenly, and Milliken, describing
                  himself as stunned and desolated, went to Wyoming for two
                  months of rest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn26" id="page-bergh-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  In letters to lenders, he deputized Wise as his representative
                  in loan affairs—not Helen Foote, a junior decorative arts
                  curator who assisted Milliken on the project—and Wise seems to
                  have visited museums and negotiated loans on Milliken’s
                  behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There can be no doubt that Wise was a businessman whose
                  activities were calculated to advance his commercial
                  interests. But Coe, who knew him well and advises caution in
                  judging activities that occurred in a climate radically
                  different from today’s, describes Wise as a benefactor and
                  good friend when it came to the CMA and Milliken.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn27" id="page-bergh-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  Wise’s motivations for being so may be revealed in a
                  conversation he had in 1945 with Natacha Rambova, an American
                  Hollywood costume and set designer interested in tracing
                  designs that appear in art across cultures. She related the
                  conversation in a letter to Milliken, writing that Wise “feels
                  about that Museum as you do. In a way he feels it is also his
                  baby and would do anything he can to help your pre-Columbian
                  wing. Apparently, he has been fighting for this early American
                  art for years and seems to want to leave something worthwhile,
                  to feel he has been able to accomplish something of real
                  value.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn28" id="page-bergh-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Milliken left no explanation of his own reasons for pursuing
                  the ancient Americas so avidly except to say that it was a
                  matter of opportunity following a lucky coincidence—the
                  meeting that involved the Isthmian pendant (see figure 8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn29" id="page-bergh-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  His report of his first encounter with Norweb’s Andean
                  textiles, during which he described himself as “breathless”
                  and “transfixed,” suggests that, at least at the beginning,
                  the area may have been one of the intense enthusiasms for
                  which he was known, this one reinforced by Norweb’s and Wise’s
                  mutual interest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn30" id="page-bergh-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In CMA publications, Milliken’s effort with the ancient
                  American collection is usually said to be among his greatest
                  achievements—and one he shared with Norweb.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn31" id="page-bergh-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  They were abetted by the other donors discussed here and
                  probably also by wartime disruption of European and Asian
                  markets, competitive pricing of ancient American arts compared
                  to those of many other places and periods, and interest in
                  Pan-Americanism that was widespread at the time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn32" id="page-bergh-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  When Milliken retired in 1958, he left the museum’s Andean
                  holdings about twice as strong numerically as those from
                  either of the other two regions, though the collection is also
                  said to have been noted for its Isthmian gold, thanks in part
                  to Humphreys.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn33" id="page-bergh-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Besides textiles, holdings were also strongly focused on the
                  small, precious, three-dimensional objects that were
                  Milliken’s predilection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  <em>Art of the Americas</em> Exhibition (November 9,
                  1945–January 6, 1946)
                </h2>
                <p>
                  As noted above, in 1945, with Helen Foote’s and Wise’s help,
                  Milliken organized <em>Art of the Americas</em>, which,
                  strikingly, was one of the few largish exhibitions the museum
                  staged in the postwar period.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn34" id="page-bergh-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  His intention for the show seems to have been, in part, to
                  celebrate new acquisitions, which, in his opinion, had boosted
                  CMA’s ancient American collection into the first rank. Above
                  all, however, was his nationally noteworthy ambition to prove
                  that the “art of the Western Hemisphere can stand on its own
                  feet.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn35" id="page-bergh-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  It follows that the exhibition made no pretense of being
                  comprehensive, instead embracing quality and beauty as the
                  sole criteria for object selection—borrowing a phrase from
                  Milliken, an <em>ARTnews</em> review valorized the “strange
                  beauty” of ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn36" id="page-bergh-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  The result was an unsystematic sampling of all three ancient
                  culture areas that brought together works from twenty-seven
                  institutions, private collectors, and dealers around a core of
                  CMA objects. The show, which is documented in a series of
                  black-and-white photos, was laid out in geographic clusters in
                  two galleries, with Andean textiles ranged along the walls to
                  encircle large cases containing objects of clay, metal, and
                  other media.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Certain design features seem to have advanced Milliken’s goal
                  for the show. For instance, cases were divided internally by
                  panels in an arrangement that, according to <em>ARTnews</em>,
                  showed each object in its “most felicitous aspect”—in other
                  words, as a work of art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn37" id="page-bergh-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Also, other three-dimensional objects were placed individually
                  on pedestals against the walls, perhaps to emphasize their
                  sculptural qualities and silhouettes, in addition to calling
                  them to visitors’ attention. Finally, though the old
                  installation photos are grainy and often difficult to
                  decipher, texts and other interpretive materials seem to have
                  been minimal, as though to reduce distractions that would
                  compete with the artworks.

                  In the <em>Bulletin</em> and many letters to lenders and
                  donors, Milliken exulted that the show was “one of the most
                  successful and popular” in the museum’s history and that it
                  drew enthusiastic, appreciative visitors from both the East
                  and West Coasts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn38" id="page-bergh-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  One was M. D. C. Crawford, a self-taught expert and champion
                  of ancient Andean textiles, consultant to major museums, and
                  trustee of the Textile Museum in Washington, DC, among other
                  things. His reaction appears to have been representative: “I
                  think it is, barring none, the finest exhibition of its kind
                  for choice and presentation I have ever seen.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn39" id="page-bergh-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Local response was no less rapt; for instance, after seeing
                  the show, N. R. Howard, editor of the
                  <em>Cleveland News,</em> wrote to a board member, “That durn
                  show moved me more than anything I have seen for a long
                  time.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn40" id="page-bergh-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  Perhaps due to this reception, after the show closed the
                  museum invested an amount of money that today is
                  surprising—$5,300 (now, over $70,000)—in a small,
                  fifty-eight-page booklet to create a pictorial record of the
                  effort (fig. 11).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn41" id="page-bergh-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>

                  The Monuments Men: Sherman Lee and Henry Hawley (1958–89)
                </h2>
                <p>
                  When Milliken departed, Sherman E. Lee (1918–2008) soon
                  succeeded him to become the institution’s third director.
                  Familiar with the museum through his service as Curator of
                  Oriental Art since 1952, he lost no time in expressing his
                  “strong feeling” that the ancient American collection required
                  “larger sculptures and . . . other items . . . not already
                  represented in the collection.” He made this stipulation in a
                  letter to Wise that accompanied the return of three dozen
                  small objects that apparently had been at the museum for
                  Milliken’s consideration.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn42" id="page-bergh-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Also, an analysis revealed that the decorative arts had
                  received the lion’s share of acquisition funds since the
                  museum’s founding, while Western paintings languished. Thus,
                  Lee and the trustees, soon to be led by Norweb, agreed in the
                  future to devote no more than 15 percent of the budget to the
                  decorative arts, including ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn43" id="page-bergh-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  Another decision, unspoken in memos but clear in acquisition
                  records, was to diversify the sources from whom material was
                  purchased. Supplanted by a variety of other sellers, Wise
                  placed only a few more works with the museum before he died in
                  1981.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn44" id="page-bergh-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>

                  Despite constraints, a number of the collection’s most iconic
                  works were purchased over the next decade under the guidance
                  of Henry H. Hawley (d. 2019), another European decorative arts
                  specialist who assumed responsibility for the Indigenous
                  Americas when he was hired in 1960 (fig. 12). He arrived at
                  the CMA fresh from the University of Delaware Winterthur
                  Program, where he wrote a master’s thesis about Euro-American
                  decorative arts. No doubt responding to Lee’s imperatives
                  about collection development, with which he may have agreed,
                  in the 1960s, Hawley bought four of the museum’s largest
                  ancient American objects (excluding textiles), most obviously
                  the nine-foot-tall front face of a Maya stela, together with
                  several smaller works (figs. 13 and 14). All but a few are
                  from Mesoamerica, perhaps due in part to an interest in
                  correcting the collection’s Andean tilt. Also, the
                  Mesoamerican art market more frequently offered the
                  large-scale works that were of interest at the time, a decade
                  during which the illicit removal of monumental and
                  architectural art from Mexico and Guatemala reached a
                  crescendo.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn45" id="page-bergh-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  Aesthetically, Hawley leaned toward the region’s realistic
                  styles, especially Maya.

                  During the 1970s, Hawley remained in charge of the ancient
                  American collection, purchasing a few more of its best-known
                  works. Except for a handful of gifts, however, acquisitions
                  stopped after 1973 due to increasing sensitivities about
                  collecting that culminated in the 1970 UNESCO convention on
                  cultural property and its guidelines for diminishing the
                  illegal traffic in antiquities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn46" id="page-bergh-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  By the early 1980s, Hawley seems to have transferred care of
                  the ancient Americas to Virginia Crawford, an assistant
                  decorative arts curator. During his stewardship, he presided
                  over a dramatic decline in acquisitions caused by the shifting
                  milieu and a thinning of the ranks of the group of donors who
                  had clustered around Milliken. But Hawley’s contributions,
                  characterized by their great beauty and refinement, had a
                  considerable impact on the collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the next sixteen years, the museum purchased only one
                  ancient American object, an Aztec gold warrior figurine,
                  during the directorship of Evan H. Turner, Lee’s successor. A
                  modernist and self-described “paintings man” whose interests
                  lay outside the Americas, Turner nevertheless seems to have
                  masterminded the CMA’s 1986 participation in an important
                  ancient American exhibition organized by the Kimbell Art
                  Museum:
                  <em>The Blood of Kings: A New Interpretation of Maya Art</em>,
                  one of the CMA’s most successful exhibitions of the decade and
                  one that gave rise to a local community of Maya
                  enthusiasts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn47" id="page-bergh-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  Its popularity may have encouraged Turner to undertake the
                  museum’s first attempt to recruit a curator trained in the
                  ancient American specialty when Crawford, who shepherded the
                  exhibition through its Cleveland appearance, resigned her

                  Margaret Young-Sánchez arrived in 1989, as she was finishing a
                  doctoral dissertation about Andean textiles in Columbia
                  University’s art history program. Apparently coincidentally,
                  the following year saw the arrival of the largest gift in the
                  collection’s history—149 objects from the estate of James and
                  Florence Gruener (1903–1990; 1908–1982), long-time
                  Clevelanders and museum supporters who had retired to
                  California. During the 1930s, the Grueners began to travel
                  widely in Mexico, where they became fascinated by folk and
                  ancient art traditions alike. Her attraction appears to have
                  been aesthetic while his interest was in the perceived
                  similarities among the religions of Native America and other
                  parts of the world, and he eventually self-published a book on
                  the topic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn49" id="page-bergh-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  Most of their collection is Mesoamerican, representing a
                  relatively complete sampling of the region’s major styles

                  Once Young-Sánchez had processed and organized an exhibition
                  of the bequest, she embarked on a very active acquisition
                  campaign during the brief directorship of medievalist Robert
                  Bergman (1993–99).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn50" id="page-bergh-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Concerned more with quality than with filling gaps or
                  balancing regional representation, she collected with a
                  relatively even hand across the three ancient culture areas,
                  buying to both strengths, especially the Maya collection, and
                  weaknesses, including Isthmian region ceramics, as objects of
                  high caliber became available (figs. 16 and 17).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn51" id="page-bergh-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  A notable exception to her collecting practice was Andean
                  textile holdings, which had been static since Norweb’s
                  foundational gifts of the 1940s and remained so in the 1990s
                  due to the textile curator’s interest in other traditions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn52" id="page-bergh-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  A few patterns established during Hawley’s tenure continued.
                  First, acquisitions came from a range of dealers. Also, apart
                  from the Gruener bequest, few other gifts arrived, the most
                  significant of which was from Clara Taplin Rankin, a veteran
                  of the Milliken era, long-time trustee, and supporter of the
                  ancient Americas. Frances (Franny) Prindle Taft (1921–2017)
                  also contributed to building the collection via her
                  decades-long trusteeship rather than donations.

                <p>
                  Records of Young-Sánchez’s activity during the decade—not only
                  acquisitions but also publications, reinstallation, and
                  exhibitions (both realized and proposed)—create the impression
                  of a determined effort to amplify the voice of the Americas
                  within the museum after a long period of relative quiescence
                  and to improve national awareness of the collection, which she
                  described as “one of the finest in the US.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn53" id="page-bergh-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  She had been hired as an assistant curator of decorative arts.
                  Before resigning in 1999, she had succeeded in establishing a
                  department independent of the decorative arts that included
                  not only the arts of the Americas but also the arts of Africa
                  and Oceania, which had been part of her portfolio.

                  In 2000, I assumed the Americas position, also shortly after
                  completing a doctoral thesis about Andean textiles at Columbia
                  University, and served in it for over two decades. I will
                  leave to a future curator the task of summarizing my
                  collection development activities except to say that, as in
                  the museum’s early days, efforts focused most strongly on
                  Andean arts, including textiles, now in an attempt to put them
                  on more equal footing with the Mesoamerican holdings that had
                  come to dominate the collection (fig. 18). I did so in the
                  belief that, when possible, fine objects with pre-1970
                  provenance should be safeguarded and made available for study
                  in museums while collecting standards, relationships with
                  source countries, and guidelines for repatriation continue to
                  evolve. A major loan exhibition that I organized,
                  <em>Wari: Lords of the Ancient Andes</em> (2010), also
                  concerned the central Andes.

                <p>
                  During my tenure, another full-circle moment occurred in 2022,
                  when the museum adopted an “Indigenous Peoples and Land
                  Acknowledgment” that, without explicitly intending to do so,
                  renewed the museum’s 1920 resolution to foster appreciation of
                  Indigenous American arts and the alternative ways of thought
                  they embody.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn55" id="page-bergh-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  Importantly, the acknowledgment also updated the early
                  resolution by orienting attention as much toward people as
                  toward art, especially building collaborative relationships
                  with Indigenous artists and communities. In this spirit, I
                  wrote the acknowledgment, my last official act, following the
                  directions of a committee of local Native North American
                  advisors, some of whom belong to historic Ohio tribes, such as
                  the Haudenosaunee, who were driven from the state after the
                  1830 passage of the Indian Removal Act. The families of
                  others, including members of Pueblo and Lakota nations, had
                  moved to Cleveland under the auspices of the federal urban
                  relocation programs in the 1950s through the 1970s. Since the
                  acknowledgment was adopted, and in contrast to a decades-long
                  pattern of neglecting Indigenous North American arts, the CMA
                  has added several contemporary works to its collection—the
                  first was
                  <a href="#page-https-www-clevelandart-org-art-2022-98" target="_blank"><em>Survival</em></a>, a suite of color lithographs by the Salish, Shoshone, and
                  Métis artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn56" id="page-bergh-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  It remains to be seen whether this refreshed and reoriented
                  commitment will transform into an acquisition program that
                  bypasses the world of the archaeological past to focus on the
                  realm of the living and the present throughout the Indigenous
                  Americas.
                </p>
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                  The Cleveland Museum of Art’s ancient American collection is
                  the result of early aspirations concerning the Indigenous
                  Americas that did not begin to be realized until the
                  mid-twentieth century. Efforts often reflected preoccupations
                  not unique to Cleveland.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn57" id="page-bergh-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  Most centrally, from the outset, CMA directors and curators
                  joined a broader, well-known struggle to improve these arts’
                  respectability and appeal to Euro-American audiences,
                  including academics whose interest would promote further
                  study. They did so through attempts to validate the material
                  as art rather than archaeological artifact. This endeavor was
                  among the many factors that led to a livelier interest and
                  market in ancient American arts, which, in turn, fed
                  midcentury collecting peaks in Cleveland and elsewhere. In the
                  1970s, ancient American collecting declined at the CMA, as it
                  did at other institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast to some other museums, Cleveland’s collection is
                  largely the result not of gifts, with obvious exceptions, but
                  rather of purchases that were matters of curatorial
                  discretion. In terms of its sources, the collection may be
                  unusual in its midcentury dependence on a single dealer and
                  the friendship to which that dependence owed. It also may be
                  unusual in the involvement of so many women in its formation,
                  Norweb first among them but also Bole, Ford, Humphreys,
                  Ingalls, Rankin, Taft, and others. The motivations for their
                  engagement with ancient American arts are not recorded but may
                  have had to do, in part, with affordability, as Norweb once
                  implied. Their interest could also have had roots in the
                  Euro-American tendency to affiliate women, as well as the
                  racialized Other, with material that the West pejoratively
                  classified as decorative arts, or crafts, including the
                  elaborate ceramics, textiles, and personal ornaments of the
                  Americas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn58" id="page-bergh-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  It is hoped that the present volume, the first of its kind,
                  will shed more light on these and other factors that have
                  shaped US museum collections over the last century.

                  Addendum: Other Ohio Collections of Ancient American Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Among other collections in Ohio, the largest and finest is at
                  the Dayton Art Institute. In round numbers, permanent holdings
                  comprise 170 works of art that are supplemented by 120 objects
                  on loan since 2000 from the foundation of the late Dayton
                  philanthropists Harold W. and Mary Louise Shaw. The permanent
                  collection, the result of gifts and purchases since the 1930s,
                  incorporates a range of styles from both the Andes, including
                  a rare Wari inlaid conch shell trumpet (<a href="#page-https-daytonart-emuseum-com-objects-781-strombus-shell-ctx-1f55cca822ced08c62070fb3711085e6043e6dd6-and-idx-6" target="_blank">1970.32</a>), and Mesoamerica, with strength in the Maya, notably a
                  carved stone panel depicting an enthroned couple (<a href="#page-https-daytonart-emuseum-com-objects-857-carved-panel-with-enthroned-nobles-ctx-b44f101b5aad2487644cee26b9de622a49d7c65a-and-idx-1" target="_blank">1970.37</a>). The Shaw collection, which is said to have been assembled
                  by the early 1970s, focuses first on Mesoamerica, again
                  especially the Maya—another stone panel features a standing
                  couple—followed by the Isthmian Region.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn59" id="page-bergh-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ashland University in
                  Ashland, Ohio, accepted several ancient American donations
                  that have not been described but are made up at least in part
                  of Andean ceramics. Information about the Cincinnati Art
                  Museum’s collection is likewise limited, but holdings seem to
                  comprise about one hundred ancient Andean objects, one-third
                  of them acquired in an early purchase, in 1883, and the rest
                  by subsequent gifts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn60" id="page-bergh-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  Most of the 150 ceramic works at the Columbus Museum of Art
                  represent Mesoamerican styles, especially west Mexican, some
                  purchased in the 1980s and earlier; among several gifts are
                  fifty works from the collection of Eva Glimcher, cofounder
                  with her son, Arne, of New York’s Pace Gallery. The styles of
                  the seventy objects at Oberlin College’s Allen Memorial Art
                  Museum range from Mexican to Peruvian; half, including many
                  fragments, belong to a study collection. The Toledo Museum of
                  Art’s principal ancient American holdings are some eighty
                  ceramic vessels from Panama’s Chiriquí region; the majority
                  were donated in 1907 and come from Yale University’s Peabody
                  Museum, which deaccessioned them as duplicates, a common early
                  practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-bergh-fn61" id="page-bergh-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>

                        In the 1950s, Samuel K. Lothrop, archaeologist at
                        Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology,
                        agreed to have Peabody staff survey Norweb’s property on
                        Panama’s Azuero Peninsula with the understanding that
                        the CMA would receive any exhibitable ancient objects
                        that might result. The property, however, could not be
                        accessed. See 1951–52 letters among Lothrop, Norweb, and

                        However, acquisition funds greatly increased in 1957
                        after half of Leonard Hanna’s $34 million bequest was
                        devoted to art purchases.

                        In retirement, Milliken remained in touch with Wise (see
                        figure 9) and wrote the foreword to the catalog for an
                        exhibition, <em>World of Ancient Gold</em>, that Wise
                        organized at the New York World’s Fair in 1964–65. Wise
                        bequeathed his collection and papers to the Dallas
                        Museum of Art. According to the late, long-time Dallas
                        curator Carol Robbins, however, the Wises had always
                        anticipated that their collection would find a home in
                        Cleveland (personal communication with the author, June
                        12, 2007). The shifting wind that followed Milliken’s
                        retirement in Cleveland likely explains their change of
                        mind, at least in part.

                        In the mid-1950s, during Sherman Lee’s directorship,
                        scores of Native North American objects in the permanent
                        collection were transferred to the education art
                        collection, over Henry Hawley’s objections. Memo from

                        the 2000s; also, Young-Sánchez acquired several North
                        American objects in the 1990s.

                  The Art Institute of Chicago’s building is a remnant of the
                  city’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, which celebrated the
                  400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s voyage to the
                  Americas. Columbus’s arrival in the “New World” was framed as
                  a decisive moment within an overarching vision of a uniquely
                  American cultural and industrial progress (fig. 1). The
                  organizers sought to reveal the foundation of modern America
                  through the scientific study of its “Native peoples.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn1" id="page-pope-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  The Exposition offered many their first engagement with

                  The artifacts gathered for the Exposition became the founding
                  collection for the new Columbian Museum of Chicago (later the
                  Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago Natural History
                  Museum, and finally the Field Museum), while the Art Institute
                  would move into the headquarters of the World’s Congress
                  Auxiliary in the heart of Chicago. Manifesting the ideal
                  “White City” presented by the Exposition, this Beaux-Art
                  building has a facade etched with the names of Western
                  history’s most important painters, sculptors, and
                  architects—asserting itself as an art institution in the
                  classical European model. The collections of the Art Institute
                  long reflected this perspective, with no interest in works
                  from the ancient or Indigenous Americas. Exhibiting
                  pre-Columbian and North American objects in natural history or
                  anthropological institutions, rather than an art museum, was
                  the standard practice of the day; it would take several
                  decades until these “artifacts” were regarded as “art” and
                  displayed alongside other celebrated artistic traditions.

                  Few ancient or Indigenous American objects entered the Art
                  Institute’s permanent collection during the fifty years after
                  its founding in 1879. They typically were modest gifts from
                  civic-minded local philanthropists, such as the assortment of
                  broken clay figures, earflares, and spindle whorls from
                  ancient Mexico given in 1907—the first works from Mesoamerica
                  acquired by the museum (fig. 3). With no curatorial department
                  dedicated to the collection and display of these works, most
                  were placed within the Decorative Arts department, “all but

                  Although the introduction of modern art to Chicago was
                  fraught, it was through early-twentieth-century
                  modernism—specifically the interest in the aesthetics of
                  “primitive art”—that ancient and Indigenous American works of
                  art gained their place at the Art Institute.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn4" id="page-pope-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Katharine Kuh (1904–1994) was essential to bringing modern
                  avant-garde artists and non-Western art to the attention of
                  the city and the museum (fig. 4). Kuh’s desire to be a pioneer
                  led her to a career as a gallerist, art educator, curator, art
                  consultant, and critic, specializing in modern art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn5" id="page-pope-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  She learned about a new approach to teaching and displaying
                  art through Alfred H. Barr Jr., with whom Kuh took an art
                  history class during college. Barr, the founding director of
                  the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA; 1929–40), would become Kuh’s
                  mentor and collaborator.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn6" id="page-pope-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  His advocacy of art of the day, visually focused methods for
                  teaching art, explorations of the aesthetic connections
                  between modern and non-Western art, and formalist approach to
                  art installation were fundamental to Kuh’s own practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn7" id="page-pope-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>

                  In 1935, Kuh opened the first commercial gallery in Chicago
                  devoted to avant-garde artists (fig. 5). Contemporary works
                  were often juxtaposed with “various kinds of primitive art,”
                  reflecting a modernist perspective in which non-Western art
                  was embraced as a source of visual inspiration and
                  authenticity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn8" id="page-pope-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Kuh’s gallery opened just two years after MoMA’s influential
                  exhibition <em>American Sources of Modern Art</em>, which
                  presented pre-Columbian objects as works of art in an art
                  museum through a formalist, aesthetic appreciation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn9" id="page-pope-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kuh found it difficult to find buyers for the avant-garde in
                  conservative Chicago, and with World War II limiting her
                  access to the European artists she promoted, she was forced to
                  close her gallery in 1942. Kuh’s creative engagement with
                  modern art was widely recognized, and she was hired by the
                  director of the Art Institute, Daniel Catton Rich (1904–1976).
                  Initially working in public relations, she was soon appointed
                  to lead the Gallery of Art Interpretation, which Kuh
                  transformed into an experimental museum space whose primary
                  objective was to teach adult audiences about contemporary
                  art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn10" id="page-pope-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following Kuh’s intention “to teach art visually,” labels and
                  texts were eliminated as much as possible, encouraging direct,
                  uninterrupted, visual engagement with individual works of
                  art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn11" id="page-pope-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  The Gallery of Art Interpretation also “focus[ed] on the art
                  of the present and recent past and [related] it not just to
                  the history of western art but to that of other cultures
                  (oriental, pre-Columbian, African, folk, etc.).”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn12" id="page-pope-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Audiences were introduced to visual vocabularies different
                  than traditionally used in Western art, inviting consideration
                  of color, texture, and space.

                  Kuh’s first installation in the Gallery of Art Interpretation
                  was an “explanatory exhibition” that complemented the Art
                  Institute’s 1944 exhibition on José Guadalupe Posada
                  (1852–1913), the first large-scale presentation of the
                  artist’s work in the United States (fig. 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn13" id="page-pope-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  Described as a “condensed introductory show to familiarize
                  patrons with the background and technique of the artist
                  represented in the main exhibition halls,” Kuh’s exhibition
                  provided a foundation for the general public to approach the
                  work of Posada, a largely unknown artist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kuh’s exhibition posed the question: “Who is Posada?” To
                  answer, Kuh created a free-flowing space—designed with Bauhaus
                  architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe—organized around a series
                  of explanatory ideas. The installation visually engaged with
                  the audience using “blow-ups, photographs, actual objects,
                  diagrams, and, of course, original prints” and included a
                  variety of objects from Mexico’s past and present.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn14" id="page-pope-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Highlighting Posada’s engagement with Mexican culture, the
                  exhibition included works of art from the country’s popular
                  and ancient traditions; however, because the Art Institute did
                  not have a collection of significant pre-Columbian works,
                  several objects had to be borrowed from Chicago’s Field Museum
                  of Natural History, including an Aztec
                  <em>Coiled Rattlesnake</em> (<a href="#page-https-collections-anthropology-fieldmuseum-org-catalogue-1278172" target="_blank">48126</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn15" id="page-pope-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>

                <h2>The Eduard Gaffron Collection</h2>
                <p>
                  With her experience working with non-Western objects, Kuh
                  understood the significance when she learned of an opportunity
                  for the museum to acquire one of the largest collections of
                  ancient Andean art in private hands: the Eduard Gaffron
                  Collection. In late 1948, Kuh met Dr. Hans Gaffron, then an
                  associate professor at the University of Chicago, who told her
                  about his father’s collection, which he and his sister,
                  Mercedes Gaffron, had inherited upon his death in 1931.
                  Informed of the family’s desire to determine the future of the
                  collection, Kuh encouraged Hans to write to Rich, the Art
                  Institute’s director. This was the catalyst that led to the
                  museum’s purchase of the famed Gaffron Collection and,
                  ultimately, the establishment of a new department dedicated to
                  primitive art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn16" id="page-pope-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>

                  Eduard Gaffron was a German doctor who lived in Peru from 1892
                  to 1912, during which time he actively collected ancient
                  Peruvian works (fig. 7). Most of his collection likely was
                  purchased through an informal market of looted objects; some
                  may have been acquired during unofficial excavations or by
                  exchange in lieu of payment for his medical services.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn17" id="page-pope-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  While ancient Peruvian art and culture was generally
                  overlooked at the time, Gaffron’s interest would have suited
                  his status in Peru where, by the mid-nineteenth century, “the
                  display of antiquities in parlors and salons was confined to
                  the highest strata of Lima society . . . to own and to display
                  antiquities, to bring them out and show them to one’s guests
                  after dinner, appears to have constituted an element of elite
                  sociability in the city of Lima.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn18" id="page-pope-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>

                  Gaffron returned to Berlin in 1912 with his collection, which
                  he continued to refine through sales, purchases, and
                  exchanges, ultimately numbering in the tens of thousands.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn19" id="page-pope-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  The Eduard Gaffron Collection was widely known among scholars
                  and fellow enthusiasts and was published several times in
                  German, English, and French, initially in 1924 by Walter
                  Lehmann and Heinrich Ubbelohde-Doering.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn20" id="page-pope-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Gaffron donated and sold large portions of his holdings to
                  museums and private collectors in Europe and the United States
                  so that at the time of his death, the collection numbered
                  approximately 1,300 objects, mostly ancient Andean ceramics
                  but also textiles, metalwork, and stone. Because of the
                  upheavals in Germany and restrictions placed on the export of
                  art, when Hans left the country in 1931, the bulk of the
                  collection remained in Germany, stored at Staatliches Museum
                  für Völkerkunde, Munich, where it had been under the care of
                  Ubbelohde-Doering since 1912 (fig. 8).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following Kuh’s suggestion, Hans wrote to Rich, asking for
                  advice and help in getting his father’s collection out of
                  Germany.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn21" id="page-pope-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Rich was receptive to the message, not only as a supporter of
                  modern art but also a collector of primitive art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn22" id="page-pope-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  With help from Ubbelohde-Doering, the Gaffron Collection was
                  shipped to Chicago and placed on long-term loan with the
                  museum. Because none of the Art Institute’s existing
                  curatorial departments oversaw pre-Columbian works, the loan
                  was arranged through the department of Decorative Arts, led by
                  curator Meyric R. Rogers, and Alan R. Sawyer, then the
                  assistant to the curator.

                  The Art Institute introduced the Eduard Gaffron Collection to
                  the public in a series of special exhibitions beginning in
                  April 1952 (fig. 9). The news release referred to the works as
                  “treasures,” emphasizing their aesthetic qualities and
                  artistic excellence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn23" id="page-pope-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  A typescript description of the exhibition asserts the Art
                  Institute’s role as an art museum in its presentation of this
                  previously overlooked area: “The current exhibition is
                  designed to bring out the artistic significance of the
                  material rather than its historical or archaeological
                  meaning.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn24" id="page-pope-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These objects were regarded as art and installed as such:
                  Photographs of the exhibition show simplified casework and
                  minimal didactics, allowing for the audience to visually
                  engage with individual works. Furthermore, the vessels were
                  generously spaced, with many elevated on small lifts,
                  signaling their special status. It is also of note that these
                  pre-Columbian works were not placed in juxtaposition to modern
                  paintings or sculptures but were instead presented on their
                  own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1953, Hans and Mercedes Gaffron explained their decision to
                  sell to the Art Institute in a letter to Rogers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn25" id="page-pope-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Both wanted to keep the collection together, hoping that by
                  doing so it would continue to have a connection to their
                  father. In a letter to her brother that Hans shared with
                  Rogers, Mercedes also responded positively to the Art
                  Institute’s art-focused installation, stating: “It would
                  please me particularly if the collection remained in Chicago
                  with Dr. Rogers who exhibited it so prettily instead of
                  collecting dust in a museum of natural history.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn26" id="page-pope-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Purchasing the Eduard Gaffron Collection was a major
                  undertaking for the museum. If successful, the museum would
                  need to create a new collecting area dedicated to the
                  acquisition and display of primitive art. Rogers and Rich were
                  aware of the increasing interest in non-Western art in the US
                  and abroad by museums and private collectors, that prices for
                  these works of art were rising, and opportunities to enter the
                  field were limited.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn27" id="page-pope-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  They advised that the purchase be finalized quickly.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn28" id="page-pope-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>

                  One influential group encouraging the Art Institute to
                  establish a new department for primitive art was Chicago
                  collectors, particularly those with an interest in modern art
                  and collections that included non-Western works. While the Art
                  Institute was pursuing the Gaffron Collection, Nathan
                  Cummings, a Chicago businessman who had an important
                  collection of paintings and sculptures from the mid-nineteenth
                  century to contemporary works, purchased another major private
                  collection of ancient Andean art, the Wasserman-San Blas
                  Collection (fig. 10). As B. J. Wassermann-San Blas explained
                  in the preface to his 1938 catalog, his collection—totaling
                  approximately 1,500 objects—was begun by his maternal
                  grandmother during a visit to Peru a century before, to which
                  he added through unauthorized excavations and purchases on the
                  open market.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn29" id="page-pope-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  In 1954, Wassermann-San Blas offered the works for sale to
                  several private collectors, including Cummings. Cummings had
                  known the seller for years and—after some consideration and a
                  drop in price—he purchased the collection that spring.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn30" id="page-pope-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>

                  Later that year, Cummings lent nearly two hundred ancient
                  Andean ceramics to the Art Institute for a special exhibition
                  that would later travel to museums in the US, Canada, France,
                  and Italy. Cummings worked with Sawyer—then the Assistant
                  Curator of Decorative Arts—to produce “a handbook” of his
                  newly acquired collection, rebranding it as
                  <em>The Nathan Cummings Collection of Ancient Peruvian Art</em>
                  (fig. 11). In the introduction to the small catalog, Cummings
                  stated that his interest in ancient Andean works was as a
                  collector of modern art: “Although most of the pottery was
                  made more than a thousand years ago, by Indians whose tribal
                  names are strange to our ears, it is so pleasing to the modern
                  eye that it stands as a challenge to the work of today’s
                  artists.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn31" id="page-pope-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                <h2>A New Department for Primitive Art</h2>
                <p>
                  The purchase of the Gaffron Collection in April 1955, along
                  with a promised gift from the Nathan Cummings Collection, were
                  envisioned as a “cornerstone on which to build a new division
                  of Primitive Arts.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn32" id="page-pope-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  In the <em>1954–1955 Annual Report</em>, Rich explained the
                  rationale for the founding of a new department dedicated to a
                  collecting area previously ignored by the museum: “One of the
                  great discoveries of the twentieth century is the fascinating
                  series of interlocking cultures broadly called Pre-Columbian.
                  Regarded as mere curios by their discoverers, and later
                  crowded into the cases of ethnographic museums, these ancient
                  sculptures, ceramics, and textiles are now being studied
                  seriously, and are recognized as works of art worthy to rank
                  with many of the greatest expressions of the Orient and
                  Europe.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn33" id="page-pope-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this time, questions were being raised—mostly by
                  anthropologists—asking if art museums should be collecting
                  these works at all. In a 1958 essay, Harry L. Shapiro, chair
                  of the Department of Anthropology at the American Museum of
                  Natural History, rejected efforts by US art museums to acquire
                  non-Western works, arguing, in part, that the aesthetic
                  approach of art museums removed context: “Primitive art
                  belongs with its culture and should be exhibited in reference
                  to it. Such a task belongs in the anthropological field.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn34" id="page-pope-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Art Institute responded to this opposition by
                  differentiating itself from the Chicago Natural History
                  Museum. At the first meeting of the Committee on Primitive Art
                  held on April 29, 1957, Rogers addressed concerns over “future
                  relations” with the Chicago Natural History Museum and other
                  scientific institutions, asserting: “There will be no conflict
                  in the field of Primitive Art since scientific museums are
                  interested in collecting ethnographic materials, whereas the
                  Art Institute will stress only the esthetic side and exhibit
                  primitive objects for their artistic value.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn35" id="page-pope-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sawyer was selected as the first curator of the new Primitive
                  Art department in 1958, despite having little training in
                  non-Western art. Sawyer later explained that the two “sister
                  institutions” had qualitatively different approaches to the
                  same material. In an essay promoting one of the first
                  exhibitions presented by the Primitive Art department—an
                  exhibition of Oceanic art—Sawyer hailed the Chicago Natural
                  History Museum’s Oceanic collection as one of the finest and
                  most extensive in the world; yet, through “careful selection
                  and presentation [the Art Institute] sought to emphasize the
                  great artistic achievements of the Oceanic peoples, so that
                  they can be appreciated in relation to the great creative
                  expressions of European and Asiatic peoples on view in our
                  other galleries.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn36" id="page-pope-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                <h2>Growing a Collection of Primitive Art</h2>
                <p>
                  One difficulty faced by the new department was the
                  collections’ lack of depth and breadth, with approximately
                  1,500 ancient Andean ceramics and textiles supplemented by
                  fewer than one hundred works from other culture areas. At the
                  first meeting of the committee, members recognized that the
                  ancient Andean works numbered far in excess of what could be
                  displayed and decided that “only the finest objects were to be
                  retained, the balance traded or sold to dealers, collectors,
                  and museums in order to acquire additional objects of top
                  quality.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn37" id="page-pope-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Over the course of subsequent meetings, Sawyer and the
                  committee reviewed the Gaffron Collection holdings,
                  identifying works for possible disposal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sawyer would leave the museum in 1959, so the final dispersal
                  of “surplus” Andean works would fall to Allen Wardwell, who
                  was appointed as the Assistant Curator of the Primitive Art
                  department in 1960. Although trained in decorative arts,
                  Wardwell’s master’s thesis focused on Polynesian art, and he
                  previously had worked on an African sculpture exhibition at
                  the Museum of Primitive Art. In 1961, the committee authorized
                  the exchange of ancient Andean ceramics, gold, and featherwork
                  with the Denver Art Museum, Milwaukee Public Museums, Field
                  Natural History Museum, and the New York dealer Henri Kamer
                  for works of art from Oceania, Africa, and North American
                  works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn38" id="page-pope-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>

                  As the department continued to seek opportunities to expand
                  its holdings, it continued to rely on loans from local private
                  collectors and the Chicago Natural History Museum. This
                  arrangement was made explicit with the first major exhibition
                  organized by the department,
                  <em>Primitive Art from Chicago Collections</em>, which opened
                  at the end of 1960 (fig. 12). In the exhibition catalog,
                  Wardwell remarked that more than 250 objects had been loaned
                  from fifty-three sources, demonstrating “the widespread
                  interest in the so-called ‘primitive arts’ in Chicago,” yet
                  most lenders had only a few pieces in their collections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn39" id="page-pope-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  He also acknowledged “the most important collection of
                  primitive art in Chicago is the vast amount of material
                  collected from an anthropological standpoint by the Chicago
                  Natural History Museum.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn40" id="page-pope-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Emphasizing the aesthetics of the works, the installation of
                  <em>Chicago Collections</em> was stark, with wide open spaces.
                  This allowed works from different cultures, regions, and time
                  periods to be seen in a single glance, which reinforced the
                  assumption of a cohesive category of primitive art. Discreetly
                  placed area maps and minimal didactic texts offered little
                  distraction to visual engagement with the objects, but they
                  provided only minimal guidance for the audience.

                  The focus on individual works of art and their formal
                  qualities was also the design approach in the early permanent
                  collection galleries. A photograph from the 1960s shows a
                  decontextualized, modernist display, featuring simple
                  casework, a small selection of works, and minimal text (fig.
                  13). A later description of the early primitive art
                  installation suggests that, due to the limitations of the
                  space allocated to the collection, artwork was displayed
                  according to size rather than style or place of origin,
                  prioritizing visual and formal inquiry over contextual.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn41" id="page-pope-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>

                  Even with limited funds, the young department made purchases
                  to better present the breadth of its collecting areas,
                  selecting singular masterpieces that would act as keystones
                  for the collection. In the 1960s, works from across the
                  ancient Americas were acquired, including the Teotihuacan
                  <em>Mural Fragment</em> (<a href="#page-https-www-artic-edu-artworks-14968-mural-fragment-depicting-a-maguey-bloodletting-ritual" target="_blank">1962.702</a>), Coclé <em>Pedestal Bowl</em> (<a href="#page-https-www-artic-edu-artworks-17490-pedestal-bowl-depicting-an-anthropomorphic-saurian-figure" target="_blank">1963.389</a>), Chimú <em>Tumi</em> (<a href="#page-https-www-artic-edu-artworks-18757-ceremonial-knife-tumi" target="_blank">1963.841</a>), and Maya <em>Ballplayer Panel</em> (<a href="#page-https-www-artic-edu-artworks-110246-chak-ak-paat-kuy-red-turkey-playing-the-ballgame" target="_blank">1965.407</a>). In 1965, the department published its first collection
                  catalog,
                  <em>Primitive Art in the Collections of The Art Institute of
                    Chicago</em>, a small book featuring eighty works from across non-Western
                  cultures (fig. 14). In his introduction, Wardwell acknowledged
                  that “these collections will never attain the wealth and depth
                  of those in older and better endowed institutions,” however,
                  he hoped that, in some small way, “representation of the great
                  artistic achievements of these exotic cultures can be imparted
                  to those who visit the Art Institute of Chicago.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn42" id="page-pope-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The succeeding curator of the department, Evan Maurer,
                  fundamentally transformed how the collection was presented,
                  reflecting increased specialization in academia and research
                  in the field.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn43" id="page-pope-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  Although Maurer was trained as a modernist with little
                  experience with primitive art, his 1978 reinstallation of the
                  permanent collection galleries moved away from generalized and
                  formalist displays. Instead, he offered a deeper understanding
                  of the works of art by situating them within their specific
                  cultural contexts. The collection also was relocated to larger
                  galleries, allowing for separate installations of the three
                  primary culture areas: Americas, Oceania, and Africa. Each was
                  further organized according to region, style, and medium.
                  Juxtapositions of artworks were used to highlight similar
                  motifs across media within a single culture and to demonstrate
                  differences in regional art styles. To further emphasize the
                  vast diversity of the department’s holdings within the
                  distinct collecting areas, Mauer changed the name of the
                  department to Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the departure of Maurer in 1981, the museum hired
                  Richard F. Townsend, the first curator of the department
                  trained in anthropology and art history whose expertise was in
                  the arts of the Americas, having conducted fieldwork and
                  studies in the US Southwest, Mexico, and Peru. However, two
                  principles of Townsend’s work resonated with earlier
                  approaches to ancient and Indigenous American objects at the
                  museum: the prioritization of aesthetic excellence and visual
                  engagement with individual works of art and the concept of a
                  unifying sacred world view shared by the diverse cultures of
                  the Americas.

                  With a career at the Art Institute lasting thirty-five years,
                  Townsend had a profound impact on the museum, including
                  organizing two major permanent collection reinstallations and
                  six special exhibitions. At the outset, Townsend refined the
                  collection by deaccessioning lesser quality and redundant
                  material, including Oceanic works, an area that had never been
                  actively acquired.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn44" id="page-pope-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  He then reinstalled the collection within three adjacent, yet
                  separate, galleries that underscored the newly defined
                  collecting areas: arts of Africa, the ancient Americas, and
                  Indigenous North American Indian (fig. 15). Recognizing the
                  advancements of academic fields of study and the need for
                  specialized training, a separate curatorial position was
                  established to oversee African arts in 1987.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn45" id="page-pope-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>

                  The 1992 special exhibition
                  <em>The Ancient Americas: Art from Sacred Landscapes</em>
                  reflected Townsend’s approach to the arts and cultures of the
                  Americas (fig. 16). This exhibition explored the essential
                  integration of human society with the sacred natural world. As
                  Townsend explained: “The gallery presentation was designed to
                  show that art, architecture, and ritual were engaged in
                  religious dialogue with the deified forms of earth, sky, and
                  water. We intended to show that the visual arts played an
                  active role in the ritual cycle of natural and social
                  renewal.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn46" id="page-pope-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Held during the quincentenary of Columbus’s arrival in North
                  America, the exhibition did not address European impact on the
                  Americas; instead, it showcased the great diversity and
                  artistic accomplishment of the pre-Columbian past. The
                  installation presented 280 objects from twenty-four cultures,
                  contextualized by large-scale photographs of natural
                  environments and man-made structures—the “sacred landscapes”
                  of the exhibition theme. Although some argued that the
                  conceptual underpinning was lacking from the exhibition,
                  others observed that the installation invited aesthetic
                  appreciation of the works: As one reviewer noted, “Those who
                  put quality first can also rejoice, for there is little in
                  this exhibition . . . that does not rivet the eye.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn47" id="page-pope-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>

                  I joined the department in 2005, working alongside Townsend
                  until his retirement in 2016. One major project during this
                  time was the 2011 reinstallation of the permanent collection
                  into much larger galleries (fig. 17).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn48" id="page-pope-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  Renamed “Indian Arts of the Americas,” the collection included
                  traditional works of art founded in ancient and Indigenous
                  customs and practices united by a shared world view. The
                  galleries presented a wide range of works in a large open
                  space, loosely divided into three sections, one for each of
                  three major culture areas. A centrally placed text explained
                  the overarching connection between communities and the sacred
                  world—a theme reinforced by a video displaying landscapes,
                  ritual, and architecture—while a map of the hemisphere noted
                  the location of the diverse cultures: North American,
                  Mesoamerican, and Andean.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn49" id="page-pope-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  Although organized by geographic region and culture, open
                  passages between each section allowed visitors to see the
                  broad scope of the collection, encouraging audiences to make
                  visual connections across culture, time, and space.

                  Casework was designed to be unobtrusive, and didactics were
                  kept to a minimum and separated from the objects, removing
                  distraction and distance between the visitor and the artwork.
                  Townsend stated: “Our emphasis here is rather to bring out the
                  masterpieces . . . and to display these in a way that they can
                  speak for themselves in terms of their formal qualities—form,
                  color, and shape.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn50" id="page-pope-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>

                  The culmination of Townsend’s work at the museum was the
                  publication of a collection catalog, the first since
                  Wardwell’s in 1965 (fig. 18).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn51" id="page-pope-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  Although the book presents over 350 individual works of art,
                  each discussed within their specific cultural context,
                  Townsend’s vision of a unified American sacred worldview
                  connects them all.

                  In 2020, one of the last traces of the departments’ “primitive
                  art” origins was ended, as the arts of Africa and the arts of
                  ancient and Indigenous Americas were separated and placed in
                  different curatorial departments. The American objects joined
                  with what previously was known as American Art—works made in
                  the US from the seventeenth to twentieth centuries—in a newly
                  conceived Arts of the Americas department. Currently, under
                  the curatorship of Andrew Hamilton, the museum has also
                  broadened its collecting of Indigenous American art to include
                  contemporary artists and their works. This reorganization and
                  expanded definition of American art has resulted in the
                  integration of Indigenous arts into the American art
                  galleries, offering dialogue among diverse works in the
                  collection from across the hemisphere and enabling new and
                  more complex narratives (fig. 19).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-pope-fn52" id="page-pope-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The changing assessment of ancient and Indigenous works at the
                  Art Institute of Chicago demonstrates how external perceptions
                  determine their place in the museum. Initially, objects were
                  disregarded as “artifacts” better suited for natural history
                  or anthropological institutions; later, they were incorporated
                  into the collection as decontextualized “primitive” works
                  within a modernist framework. Today, through a deeper
                  understanding of the artists and communities in which objects
                  were made and used, ancient and Indigenous works are valued as
                  unique and compelling artistic expressions. Objects do not
                  change, but through reconsideration, the Art Institute offers
                  a space for more meaningful engagement with the distinctive
                  visual traditions of the ancient and Indigenous Americas.

                        This sense of urgency likely was, in part, due to the
                        failed negotiations with Walter and Louise Arensberg for
                        their collection of contemporary and pre-Columbian art.
                        Rich and Kuh worked closely with the Arensbergs for
                        years; Kuh developed the 1949 exhibition of their modern
                        art collection, shown exclusively at the Art Institute.
                        Rich and Kuh were hesitant to include pre-Columbian
                        works in the exhibition, which Kuh did not feel
                        experienced enough to evaluate. Ultimately, the
                        Arensberg’s donated their collection to the Philadelphia
                        Museum of Art. See Berman, “An Interview with Katharine

                        out each’s holdings.

                        anthropological institutions. In 1957, the Chicago
                        Natural History Museum established a new division of
                        primitive art within the Department of Anthropology to
                        highlight this area of his holdings and installed a new

                        As early as 1965, the museum determined it would not
                        pursue Oceanic art—an area where the Chicago Natural
                        History Museum of Chicago excelled; instead, it
                        identified opportunities for growth in African and

                  A 1914 plan demonstrates porous disciplinary, cultural, and
                  chronological boundaries between and among archaeology and art
                  history based on collection availability and institutional
                  circumstances (fig. 1).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn3" id="page-robb-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  Art historian Khristaan Villela’s research indicates that
                  Gallery 12, dedicated to “Central American Antiq.” was in
                  place by 1912.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn4" id="page-robb-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Most of the objects on view came from Edgar Lee Hewett’s
                  excavations at the Maya site of Quirigua, partly underwritten
                  by the Saint Louis chapter of the Archaeological Institute of
                  America (AIA). As Villela has documented, though the AIA was
                  unhappy with Hewett’s results, it nonetheless lent the objects
                  to the museum. The chapter also assisted in organizing loans
                  of Mississippian material from well-known collector Henry M.
                  Whelpley, whose collection eventually went to the Saint Louis
                  Academy of Science.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn5" id="page-robb-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  With these small forays, Saint Louis belonged to the small
                  club of municipal American art museums that displayed
                  pre-Columbian art and archaeology (including, for a time, the
                  archaeological heritage of the ancient Midwest) in the early
                  twentieth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn6" id="page-robb-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                <h2>From “Antique” to “Primitive”</h2>
                <p>
                  By 1944, the museum had one gallery dedicated to the
                  “primitive” arts, now located in the museum’s basement
                  alongside the decorative arts period rooms, perhaps a subtle
                  suggestion that these objects were décor for a modernist
                  period room instead of art in their own right. Until the
                  1950s, the museum’s administrative and curatorial staff was
                  quite small, and the directors of this period (always male)
                  were assisted by a supporting cast of (usually female)
                  curators and assistants. The museum did not have a dedicated
                  curator for the primitive arts collection, but for thirty
                  years, it had one curator reappointed on an annual basis,
                  Thomas Hoopes, assisted by Catherine Filsinger. Hoopes had a
                  background in arms and armor and became the kind of broad
                  specialist one might expect. Filsinger seems to have provided
                  the basis for future curatorial record keeping and
                  correspondence. Hoopes and Filsinger, along with directors
                  Perry T. Rathbone and Charles Nagel, fielded a few intriguing
                  pre-Columbian acquisitions: a Teotihuacan mask (<a href="#page-https-www-slam-org-collection-objects-36955" target="_blank">5:1948</a>) in 1948 from little-known antiquities dealer Charles L.
                  Morley, one of the blue-and-yellow feather textiles (<a href="#page-https-www-slam-org-collection-objects-37604" target="_blank">285:1949</a>) discovered in Corral Redondo, Peru, from Walram V. von
                  Schoeler in 1949, and a pair of Mixteca-Puebla ceramics (<a href="#page-https-www-slam-org-collection-objects-show-on-view-true-and-featured-objects-false-and-se-85-1950-20and-2086-1950-and-object-geography-puebla-state" target="_blank">85: 1950 and 86:1950</a>) from the Stendahl Galleries in 1950. Additionally, they
                  purchased a group of Paracas textiles from dealer John Wise in
                  1956.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn7" id="page-robb-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  The AIA collections remained on loan until December 1961, when
                  the chapter held a public sale in the museum’s Sculpture
                  Hall.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn8" id="page-robb-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  One of the few items that did not sell, a vase from Hewett’s
                  excavations at Quirigua, remained on loan until 1990 when the
                  chapter declined to donate it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn9" id="page-robb-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The scattershot nature of these acquisitions underscores Saint
                  Louis’s reluctance to develop an ancient American collection
                  either because it lacked the resources or the sustained
                  interest, or both. Rathbone described an environment where,
                  perhaps as a result of the museum’s funding from a local
                  property tax, the institution lacked robust financial support
                  from the donor class, when compared to neighboring Kansas
                  City, Chicago, and Cleveland.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn10" id="page-robb-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  Eventually, a single collector with dedicated passions and
                  deep pockets would drive the establishment of entire
                  curatorial departments and become the largest single donor to
                  the museum: Morton D. May.
                </p>
                <h2>Morton D. “Buster” May</h2>
                <p>
                  Morton D. May, also known as “Buster,” collected art of all
                  kinds so voraciously that his donations from the 1950s until
                  his death in 1983 transformed the Saint Louis Art Museum into
                  the encyclopedic institution it is today. Although he is most
                  famous for his relationship with and avid support for the
                  expatriate German painter Max Beckmann (1884–1950), he donated
                  major works to almost every curatorial department in the
                  museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn11" id="page-robb-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  His donations created what is now the Department of the Arts
                  of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas (AOA), constituting about
                  65 percent of the accessioned objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His fortune came from the family’s chain of department stores,
                  which May steadily expanded in the 1950s and ’60s. He bought
                  well-established local chains like Kauffman’s in Pittsburgh,
                  D&amp;F in Denver, Meier &amp; Frank in Portland, and Hecht’s
                  in Washington, DC, among others, steadily expanding the reach
                  of May Company stores across the United States through the
                  1970s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn12" id="page-robb-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  While his business acumen is clear, his interest in art is
                  less easy to explain. His archives, donated to the museum at
                  his death and meticulously maintained and organized, do not
                  include the kind of correspondence that describes great
                  aesthetic passions, though May clearly had them. Instead, they
                  are usually documents one might expect from a businessman
                  accustomed to moving merchandise. His reflections, laconic
                  though they are, indicate an awareness of the broader trend of
                  collecting so-called primitive art alongside modernist design
                  and architecture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn13" id="page-robb-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>

                  Noting the presence of west Mexican sculpture in the home of
                  the modernist architect (and May’s uncle by marriage) Samuel
                  Marx, May decided he wanted some of his own.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn14" id="page-robb-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  Marx designed May’s residence in Ladue, a wealthy Saint Louis
                  suburb, though sadly the structure was torn down in 2005 (fig.
                  2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn15" id="page-robb-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  May’s acquisitions and loans in the 1950s focused on west
                  Mexican material, readily available from West Coast dealers
                  Edward Primus, David Stuart, and, of course, the Stendahl
                  Galleries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn16" id="page-robb-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  African and Oceanic art came from Julius Carlebach, and it is
                  in this mercantile relationship that we glean something of how
                  May understood the intersection of collecting for himself and
                  selling art commercially to a broader public. Carlebach’s
                  Madison Avenue display “caught his fancy”—but not just for
                  May’s own collection. He purchased some $20,000 worth of
                  Carlebach’s Oceanic inventory—some placed on consignment at
                  May Company stores and some sold privately.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn17" id="page-robb-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Similar exchanges for African art with Carlebach followed,
                  alongside organized touring sales that visited multiple cities
                  and involved multiple suppliers. It is tempting to connect
                  May’s interest in Oceanic art with his service in the Pacific
                  theater during World War II, but similar personal connections
                  to his other art collecting areas is lacking. More likely he
                  was participating in a broadly understood sense of the
                  businessman as a humanist and philanthropist.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn18" id="page-robb-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most of May’s objects were on anonymous loan to SLAM for many
                  years. He gave small numbers of objects until the late 1970s
                  when he began to make larger donations, including the final
                  bequest in 1983. All gifts eventually carried his name. During
                  his lifetime, May gave nearly 3,500 objects to the museum.
                  Beyond the donations that established the AOA department, he
                  also gave the museum nearly one hundred paintings and
                  sculptures by German artists or artists living and working in
                  Germany in the first half of the twentieth century. His
                  donation of Beckmann paintings makes Saint Louis’s holdings
                  the largest public collection in the world. From Russian
                  religious garments to paintings and sculpture by Pablo Picasso
                  (1881–1973) and Jean Arp (1886–1966), the breadth of May’s
                  donations places him among the great mid-twentieth-century
                  collectors whose interests spanned the cultural production of
                  Europe, the Americas, Africa, and the South Pacific.

                <p>
                  In the 1990s, figures in the world of pre-Columbian
                  art—Gillett Griffin, John Stokes, Julie Jones, David
                  Joralemon—described May to me as someone who bought in
                  quantity rather than quality and—in that most damning of
                  connoisseurial judgment—someone who lacked “an eye.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn19" id="page-robb-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  While May bought some clunkers, in my experience going through
                  the collection, as well as in conversations with colleagues at
                  SLAM, it’s clear that May cultivated a different eye. He
                  wanted to assemble a comprehensive collection of a given
                  artist, or a given period, or a given region. He didn’t care
                  if tastemakers thought late Beckmann wasn’t as good as early
                  Beckmann. He wanted the full scope of an artist’s output over
                  their career. In the case of May’s interests in Mesoamerica,
                  that focus led to some purchases that seem prescient in
                  retrospect, including a cache of small-scale obsidians,
                  purchased from Valetta Malinowska in 1970, that is unlike
                  almost anything known at the time but is very similar to
                  material excavated from the Moon Pyramid almost fifty years
                  later (fig. 3).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn20" id="page-robb-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>Administering the Collection</h2>
                <p>
                  As May’s loans and donations increased, so too did the
                  museum’s curatorial staff, in an effort to accommodate the
                  massive influx of objects and to steward the relationship
                  between the donor and the institution. Emily Rauh succeeded
                  Hoopes as a full-time curator in 1964.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn21" id="page-robb-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Her laser-like focus on contemporary art brought in major
                  works. She later married Joe Pulitzer Jr., who like May, was a
                  major donor of art and funds to the museum. Emily Pulitzer has
                  since become a cultural philanthropist in her own right.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn22" id="page-robb-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In her time at SLAM, Rauh also hired and supervised curatorial
                  staff in other areas, essentially creating one-person
                  curatorial departments. She hired Philippa “Pippa” D. Shaplin,
                  who had come to Saint Louis as a Washington University
                  “faculty wife” and started working at the museum for a
                  pittance despite her degrees from Smith College, Harvard
                  University, and Wellesley College.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn23" id="page-robb-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  Rauh promoted her to a full-time position in the wake of a
                  bitter divorce that left Shaplin a single mother. In 1968,
                  Shaplin left to become the registrar at Harvard’s Peabody
                  Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and, later, held a
                  distinguished teaching career at Tufts University.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn24" id="page-robb-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shaplin’s most significant responsibility during her tenure at
                  SLAM was managing and documenting May’s numerous incoming
                  purchases and loans. Complicating matters, May had a habit of
                  buying objects from dealers, having them sent directly to the
                  museum, and leaving them on loan without much of a commitment
                  to donations or financial support.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn25" id="page-robb-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  This could have led to chaos but for Shaplin’s assiduous
                  organization and correspondence, still evident in SLAM’s
                  curatorial files. She regularly communicated with experts at
                  other institutions and added comments to object files. Aside
                  from her own published work on Zapotec material, she has never
                  been recognized for her role in shaping SLAM’s collection and
                  doing the curatorial due diligence—politely cajoling the donor
                  for more information, diplomatically coaxing dealers for
                  confirmation, savvily gossiping with trusted colleagues and
                  academics—that make the collection and its records such a
                  valuable resource today.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn26" id="page-robb-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  All of this likely helped solidify May’s loyalty to the
                  institution. I was fortunate to exchange some letters with
                  Shaplin before she passed away in 2011. She described herself
                  as largely self-taught on the subject of pre-Columbian art,
                  leaning on the 1957 text of that other autodidact Miguel
                  Covarrubias.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn27" id="page-robb-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  She developed an eye for what the collection “needed” and what
                  might be available on the market, occasionally suggesting that
                  dealers could usefully show plumbate ceramics to May, for
                  example.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn28" id="page-robb-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Shaplin recalled May’s personal generosity with fondness, but
                  perhaps because of the ephemeral nature of phone calls and
                  day-to-day conversations, there’s little evidence that May
                  consulted her opinion on acquisitions. Instead, the archive
                  reflects his dependence on the expertise of specialists like
                  Gordon Ekholm at the American Museum of Natural History. It
                  was not unusual for May to go to a dealer, buy something, have
                  it shipped to Saint Louis, send pictures to Ekholm, and
                  finalize the purchase based on Ekholm’s evaluation and
                  opinion.

                  A special pre-Columbian exhibition—drawn from “an extensive
                  private collection” as well as the museum’s permanent
                  collection—opened in the summer of 1965.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn29" id="page-robb-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  Thereafter, the primitive art galleries, which opened in 1967,
                  were split in two, with African art on the north side and
                  pre-Columbian on the south of the museum’s lower level. The
                  modernist presentation included cork squares as an accent
                  material on the walls, perhaps meant to evoke blocks of
                  <em>tezontle</em> (fig. 4). Ignacio Bernal, the director of
                  Mexico’s Museo Nacional de Antropología (National Museum of
                  Anthropology), came to give a lecture for the opening in
                  February 1967, perhaps based on the existing relationship he
                  had with May.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn30" id="page-robb-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  May and Bernal had corresponded as the latter planned the new
                  Museo Nacional, which Bernal hoped would encompass more than
                  just the art of Mexico, as his request for Oceanic material
                  from May’s collection suggests.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn31" id="page-robb-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  May did sell Oceanic material for use in the new museum, even
                  as the objects became part of the Museo de la Culturas
                  instead. Mexican officials continued to approach May as a
                  possible source for other archaeological and ethnographic
                  objects. May suggested that they visit one of the many sales
                  of African or ancient Mediterranean material then touring May
                  Company stores. He also suggested that he would happily trade
                  this material for “surplus items” of Mexican archaeological
                  material.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn32" id="page-robb-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  Though this never came to pass, it was not immediately
                  dismissed. May was indeed recognized as one of the donors to
                  the Museo de las Culturas del Mundo.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn33" id="page-robb-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>Moving Merchandise</h2>
                <p>
                  As May and Bernal’s correspondence suggests, archaeological
                  and ethnographic objects had a much more fluid status in the
                  1960s than we might expect. For May, this is perhaps easiest
                  to understand. He moved in a world of merchandise and
                  shipments and thought nothing of selling objects as art and/or
                  as decor in his stores. May (and the May Company) even gave
                  objects away at the museum, as happened during an Association
                  of Art Museum Directors meeting in Saint Louis in May 1964 and
                  again in January 1968 at a College Art Association and Society
                  of Architectural Historians meeting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn34" id="page-robb-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>

                  As I have described elsewhere, May and James “Jimmy” Economos,
                  the May Company’s fine arts curator (who had started out
                  working for Carlebach), organized a pre-Columbian sale that
                  opened at the Famous-Barr store in January 1966.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn35" id="page-robb-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  It traveled over the next two years to several cities,
                  including Los Angeles, Portland, Cleveland, and Washington, DC
                  (fig. 5). The majority of the inventory for both the Clayton,
                  Missouri, and Los Angeles sales came from the Stendahl
                  Galleries to whom the May Company paid $95,000 for 2,350
                  objects (about $940,000 today).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn36" id="page-robb-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  And when the sale-cum-exhibition opened, it included special
                  letterpress invitations with RSVP cards for a lecture from one
                  of the nation’s experts on pre-Columbian art, Alan Sawyer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn37" id="page-robb-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Local press reported there were more than two thousand
                  objects, with the most expensive being a $12,000 “clay Maya
                  Figure with sun god headdress incised on a metal design.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn38" id="page-robb-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>

                  An accompanying photo shows a Huastec sculpture (<a href="#page-https-www-slam-org-collection-objects-8917" target="_blank">270:1978</a>) that May had purchased in 1964 from the Carlebach Gallery
                  (and that he donated to Saint Louis in 1978).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn39" id="page-robb-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  May did record the inclusion of about fifteen pieces from his
                  collection in the sale, and it seems he would have happily
                  parted with this sculpture for $8,000.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn40" id="page-robb-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  It may have helped encourage loss-leader shopping—if you won’t
                  buy the $12,000 ceramic, perhaps we can interest you in a
                  $5.00 ceramic stamp. Similarly extravagant pricing took place
                  at the sale’s next stop, the glamorous May Company store in
                  Los Angeles on Wilshire and Fairfax, designed by Samuel Marx
                  (fig. 6).

                  There was ample advertising and reporting in the local press
                  anticipating the LA show—perhaps because May Company staff
                  knew that the sales numbers for the Famous-Barr presentation
                  had been disappointing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn41" id="page-robb-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  The accounts mention the quantity of objects as well as the
                  scholarly expertise of Economos, Sawyer, and H. B. Nicholson
                  that went into vetting the material. Economos worked for the
                  Carlebach Gallery before working with May. Sawyer, as
                  mentioned, was a well-known specialist in Andean art from the
                  Textile Museum in Washington, DC. Nicholson, a professor of
                  Aztec art at the University of California, Los Angeles, lent
                  authority to evaluations of the Mesoamerican objects. This
                  gives a sense of how small and closely knit this network of
                  academics, dealers, and collectors was (figs. 7 and 8). Out of
                  some three thousand objects, prices ranged from $7.50 to
                  $50,000.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn42" id="page-robb-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  The more of something there was, the cheaper the price was.
                  These valuations both paralleled and helped reinforce
                  aesthetic hierarchies that continue to prompt scholars who
                  evaluate objects: What makes a Maya object more valuable than
                  a west Mexico object as a rule? Or a Teotihuacan vase a study
                  piece rather than a masterpiece?
                </p>
                <p>
                  May told some of his correspondents that the LA sale was not
                  successful, suggesting, in my opinion, that he did not recoup
                  his costs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn43" id="page-robb-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  But the sale and others like it impacted museums across the
                  US. Their collection databases include references to donations
                  from the May Company in the years following, and it’s also
                  possible that other donations from private individuals
                  included objects purchased at the May sales without noting
                  that provenance in their collection histories.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn44" id="page-robb-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Naranjo Stela 8, a large stone sculpture, brought drama and
                  scale to the Wilshire sale. May purchased it from Everett
                  Rassiga for $18,000 before directing his LA team to set its
                  price at $50,000.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn45" id="page-robb-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  Rassiga was one of May’s consistent suppliers, a significant
                  dealer who consistently placed major and minor objects in
                  private and public collections. Judging from letterheads, he,
                  along with his wife Eugenia Álvarez, ran antiquities shops out
                  of Dallas, Cuernavaca, and New York City. A decorated World
                  War II pilot, who transitioned to commercial aviation after
                  the war, he may have worked for American Airlines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn46" id="page-robb-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  This would explain his presence in Dallas and his affiliation
                  with the Black Tulip gallery there in the late 1950s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn47" id="page-robb-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  By the mid-1960s, Rassiga had set up an eponymous gallery in
                  New York. He lent nearly a third of the objects in
                  <em>The Jaguar’s Children</em>, curated by Michael Coe for the
                  Museum of Primitive Art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn48" id="page-robb-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  Rassiga’s most infamous role may be the looting of the Las
                  Placeres facade, but that is not the only instance of his
                  direct participation in large-scale, quasi-commercialized
                  looting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn49" id="page-robb-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In October 1966, Rassiga sold about one hundred objects to
                  May, mostly ceramic, all Early Formative, and all traceable to
                  one likely location: an area near San Pablo, Morelos, and
                  adjacent to the local cemetery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn50" id="page-robb-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Shortly thereafter, David Grove, then a graduate student at
                  UCLA working under Nicholson, worked at San Pablo as part of
                  his dissertation. Grove focused on the complex and then still
                  poorly understood relationship between Olmec sites on the Gulf
                  Coast and central Mexican sites like Las Bocas and Tlatilco
                  that showed “Olmec influence.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn51" id="page-robb-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  Grove characterized his San Pablo excavations as salvage
                  archaeology because of the evident looting and concluded that
                  the cemetery mound had contained upwards of 250 burials.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn52" id="page-robb-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  For Grove, tracing what had happened at the site involved a
                  fair amount of ethnographic fieldwork in Mexico and the United
                  States to understand the nature of local looting and
                  international collecting.

                  As it happened, May and Nicholson were in regular contact.
                  Following radiocarbon tests on a wooden Aztec sculpture, May
                  wrote to Nicholson wondering if he would be interested in
                  “carbon testing” bones May had as part of the purchase of “the
                  entire contents of a Pre-Classic burial mound.” He enclosed
                  twelve photos of some of the objects and the environs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn53" id="page-robb-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  One of the photographs shows a group of men clad in cowboy
                  hats grouped around a pickup truck as a woman selects a vessel
                  from a group lying on the ground (fig. 9). Others show single
                  objects that eventually ended up in May’s collection,
                  including one with a handwritten note: “There are several of
                  this type and better too!” The handwriting is not May’s, nor
                  does it seem to be Grove’s. I suspect that it is Rassiga’s and
                  that the photos originally came from him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early in 1968, Grove wrote to Shaplin, referencing the
                  material from San Pablo: “Most of the pot-hunting was
                  instigated by the local San Pablo farmers, who sold to anyone
                  interested. However, I think there may have been one instance
                  of paid looting at the mound, and you may have received that
                  material. I would estimate you may have 20% of the material
                  from the mound.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn54" id="page-robb-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  Shaplin put two and two together later that year in a letter
                  to Rauh: “I think Rassiga must have been fairly cooperative
                  with the American archaeologisys [<em>sic</em>]. I believe
                  they must have traced the illicit digging to him, and then he
                  told them where the stuff was. . . . ‘I’ll tell you who has
                  the stuff if you don’t tell the Mexiacn [<em>sic</em>] Museum
                  that I was the digger’ etc.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn55" id="page-robb-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of the objects May purchased from Rassiga appear in
                  Grove’s 1970 article, without naming May (much less
                  Rassiga).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn56" id="page-robb-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  Grove estimated the looted objects from San Pablo to number
                  around five hundred. It is an alarming reminder of the
                  long-term damage done to the archaeological record and to our
                  understanding of a still relatively contentious point in
                  Mesoamerican studies. All of this information was an open
                  secret to the dealer, the collector, his academic consultants,
                  and even the staff of the museum that received the objects.
                  For a variety of reasons, ranging from professional discretion
                  to personal preference and institutional inertia, the
                  knowledge lay scattered across multiple locations within
                  multiple archives. Comparable stories could be told many times
                  across all institutions that hold pre-Columbian objects.

                <h2>End of an Era</h2>
                <p>
                  Lee Parsons arrived at Saint Louis in 1974 after getting his
                  doctorate at Harvard, conducting fieldwork at Izapa and
                  Cotzumalhuapa, and working as the curator at the Milwaukee
                  Public Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn57" id="page-robb-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  He began working on May’s collection leading up to a major
                  reinstallation in 1980 and the publication of a collection
                  catalog.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn58" id="page-robb-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  Like other institutions, SLAM’s AOA department asked one
                  curator to straddle three fields. Parsons’s first publication
                  was on May’s Oceanic collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn59" id="page-robb-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                  In contrast to Shaplin, Parsons left behind very little
                  correspondence at the museum. And May’s buying days were
                  largely over, likely because of the growing pressure against
                  pre-Columbian collecting in the early 1970s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn60" id="page-robb-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  Parsons left shortly after the pre-Columbian catalog was
                  published in 1980.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn61" id="page-robb-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  He became a freelance curator for hire, working on the Zollman
                  collection and then the Kislak collection, before passing away
                  in 1996.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn62" id="page-robb-fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Parsons’s reinstallation includes some marvelously dated
                  detailing like the space-age dome vitrines (fig. 10). A
                  section of Colombian gold objects had a timed, motion
                  sensitive light. There’s a greater use of context photos
                  throughout the installation, and the division of two galleries
                  was internally understood as “masterpieces” on one side and a
                  “survey” on the other. The collection became static after
                  May’s death in 1983. Without a significant patron applying
                  pressure, the galleries completely installed, as well as the
                  existence of a useful collection catalog, the museum moved its
                  attention elsewhere, particularly to the African
                  collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn63" id="page-robb-fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>
                  Unfortunately, the saga of Mexican artist Brígido Lara and his
                  forgeries of Veracruz ceramics that populate numerous American
                  collections impacted how the museum and the community
                  understood May’s collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn64" id="page-robb-fnref64" class="footnote-ref-anchor">64</a></sup>
                  Three days of coverage in the local press took May’s
                  reputation—and the museum’s—down a few pegs. The museum didn’t
                  have a dedicated Americas specialist for the next twenty-six
                  years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I joined the museum in the summer of 2007 and worked toward a
                  complete reinstallation of the ancient American collection
                  that was completed in 2013. It included a more generous
                  presentation of the Mesoamerican collection, small galleries
                  for the Andes and the Isthmo-Colombian region, and the
                  institution’s most notable Caribbean object, a Taíno
                  <em>duho</em> collected in the nineteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn65" id="page-robb-fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                  The new presentation incorporated North America and featured
                  Southwestern pottery (some purchased in the 1940s from the
                  notorious archaeologist Fain White King of Kentucky) and a
                  selection of Mississippian material from local collections
                  curated by Amy Clark.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn66" id="page-robb-fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  In 1916, Cass Gilbert proposed a plan to expand the Saint
                  Louis Art Museum in the Beaux-Arts style.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-robb-fn67" id="page-robb-fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>
                  Such unrealized proposals can offer a glimpse of an alternate
                  timeline—a history where Edgar Hewett didn’t have a falling
                  out with funder Charles Bowditch, where the Saint Louis AIA
                  chapter received magnificent objects from Palenque, which in
                  turn created a nucleus of interest for pre-Columbian art such
                  that director Perry Rathbone was able to persuade Saint Louis
                  native Vincent Price to endow a curatorial chair for
                  pre-Columbian art that Julie Jones later occupied, with David
                  Grove as a colleague at the University of Missouri–Saint
                  Louis. All of these alternatives are present in the archive.
                  Their possibilities remind us that the collections we have are
                  highly contingent entities, despite all our best attempts to
                  smooth out their rough edges. We sort out the “fakes” from the
                  “real” and curate cases of ceramics and jades, whose
                  individual histories are fragmentary at best, in order to
                  create representative selections of a distant past in an
                  attempt to turn them into cohesive narratives for a
                  museum-going public. But, in fact, the most cohesive
                  narratives we have are the overlapping and intersecting
                  stories that emerge from close examination of institutional
                  and individual archives. If we are to understand these
                  collections and the individuals who made them in all their
                  complexity, we have to not only continue to collaborate but
                  also find ways to ensure that these connections persist for
                  future curators, museum staff, and members of the public so
                  that they can make informed decisions about what happens to

                        Founded in 1879 as the St. Louis School and Museum of
                        Fine Arts, it was known as the City Art Museum after
                        1914 and formally changed its name to the Saint Louis
                        Art Museum in 1971. See “Front Matter,”

                        The fair had included a pavilion house sponsored by
                        Mexico, but there is little evidence to suggest this had
                        any long-term impact on the museum’s interest in what

                  (MFAH), was established early in the twentieth century and
                  found a permanent home in a neoclassical building by 1924, the
                  MFAH was not early to the collecting or display of ancient
                  American art. The museum’s initial relationship with that art
                  began in earnest in the early 1960s, under the guidance of the
                  recently appointed director of the museum, James Johnson
                  Sweeney (1900–1986; fig. 1). Although central to the creation
                  of an ancient American collection, Sweeney was not a scholar
                  of the ancient Americas but a seasoned curator of modern art
                  who had amassed a significant reputation in that area. Well
                  before his arrival in Houston, Sweeney was committed to a view
                  of non-Western art that highlighted that art’s utility to the
                  contemporary project of constructing a modernist visual
                  vocabulary. The initial impulse to collect and exhibit
                  seriously in this area was shaped to some extent by Sweeney’s
                  modernist commitments, certainly, but it was also as a way to
                  garner national attention for the museum as the decade of the
                  1960s opened and Sweeney arrived from New York. These
                  institutional goals drove the initial collecting of ancient
                  American art as much or more than any scholarly concerns such
                  as wide coverage of ancient American regional traditions or
                  building deep collections in specific areas.

                <h2>
                  Before Sweeney: The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, in 1961
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Before 1961 and Sweeney’s arrival as director, the MFAH’s
                  ancient American collections consisted of a donation of one
                  west Mexican ceramic sculpture given by John (1904–1973) and
                  Dominique (1908–1997) de Menil along with a number of small
                  ceramic and stone figures from Mesoamerica. By the time
                  Sweeney left the director position in 1967, the ancient
                  American collection included several hundred objects, mostly
                  from Mesoamerica, including a handful of what would be
                  considered masterworks. The museum also held one major
                  international exhibition of ancient American art,
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em>, discussed below, as well as an
                  extensive exhibition highlighting the growth in the permanent
                  collection. Sweeney achieved this remarkable growth in ancient
                  American art collecting and display without the aid of a
                  curator in the area. The first curator of ancient American art
                  at the MFAH wouldn’t arrive until twenty years later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What gave Sweeney the cachet—if not the expertise—to transform
                  the ancient American collections at the MFAH? James Johnson
                  Sweeney was considered a major force in the New York art world
                  for decades before his arrival in Houston. He had done
                  extensive curatorial work at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)
                  in its early years, creating important exhibitions between
                  1935 and 1946. He was briefly the head of painting and
                  sculpture at MoMA in 1945–46. More important for this context,
                  however, was his long run as the director of the Guggenheim
                  Museum, beginning in 1952 and ending in 1960, shortly before
                  he took up the directorship of the MFAH. It was Sweeney who
                  oversaw the construction of the Frank Lloyd Wright building
                  for the Guggenheim, and he installed the first exhibitions in
                  that new, idiosyncratic space. Soon after the Wright building
                  opened in late 1959, it became clear that Sweeney was unhappy
                  with the new space and other institutional constraints and
                  would be leaving.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn1" id="page-koontz-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Sensing an opening, important MFAH trustees John and Dominique
                  de Menil, who moved in similar New York circles, invited
                  Sweeney to consider the MFAH directorship. Sweeney would soon
                  assent, although it took almost a year for him to put things
                  in order and move to Houston, arriving only in 1961.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a long director search that seemed to be going nowhere,
                  the trustees were excited to have found someone of Sweeney’s
                  stature. John de Menil later called Sweeney “one of the most
                  famous museum directors, nationally and internationally.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn2" id="page-koontz-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  He and other trustees felt that the MFAH was in the midst of
                  significant change. The trustees were clearly in favor of a
                  much larger role for the museum on the national stage. The
                  search committee chair, S. I. Morris (1914–2006), framed
                  Sweeney’s hire as an “energetic plan to establish Houston as a
                  national center of the arts.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn3" id="page-koontz-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  As the museum press release on Sweeney’s hiring stated:
                  “[MFAH] should take its place as one of the significant
                  museums of the United States and of the world.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn4" id="page-koontz-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Sweeney’s charge, reiterated in no uncertain terms in
                  correspondence to the incoming director, was to put the MFAH
                  in the national and even international media discourse. In
                  sum, Sweeney was considered a cosmopolitan and a giant in the
                  US art world at a time when the MFAH trustees, led by John de
                  Menil, wanted to increase Houston’s notoriety in the larger
                  art world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While trustees saw Sweeney as a national figure in museum
                  administration that would increase the museum’s visibility and
                  prestige, Sweeney saw himself as much more than simply an
                  effective museum director. He was also a tastemaker.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn5" id="page-koontz-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  Sweeney was first and always an advocate for what he
                  considered the best, most advanced modern art—<em>The New York Times</em>
                  described him as “the arbiter of Modern Art” in a profile they
                  did on the eve of his move to Houston.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn6" id="page-koontz-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  He viewed the role of the museum as an elevating experience
                  for the viewer and was loath to focus on more purely didactic
                  opportunities with his exhibitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn7" id="page-koontz-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  The visual experience of the best modern art should be the
                  central focus of the museum, in Sweeney’s view.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn8" id="page-koontz-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Elevating taste, which was about developing discernment in the
                  viewer, was more important to Sweeney than art-historical
                  facts and sequences. Sweeney’s privileging of the cultivation
                  of taste over more pedagogical concerns was the deciding
                  factor in the split between the Guggenheim and Sweeney, with
                  the Guggenheim wanting a more robust education program and
                  Sweeney decidedly against such a development.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn9" id="page-koontz-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Sweeney was also against the ideal of the encyclopedic museum,
                  insofar as the optimal museum experience should consist of
                  seeing “not more than 150 paintings” and institutions should
                  be “as big as a bistro . . . and no bigger.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn10" id="page-koontz-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  In sum, Sweeney’s ideal museum was focused on an elevated
                  visual experience that moved the modernist discourse forward.
                  Much of the activity around ancient American art collecting
                  and display may be seen in this context.

                <p>
                  In 1962, or within a year of settling in Houston, James
                  Johnson Sweeney used his discretionary fund—a newly created
                  fund that was a prerequisite for his coming to Houston—to
                  acquire a Classic Maya stone panel (fig. 2). There was nothing
                  remotely like this large and expertly carved low relief in the
                  museum collection, but such an acquisition at this time was
                  not unusual on a national level. The early 1960s saw other
                  Classic Maya pieces of similar quality enter various US public
                  collections, including Nelson Rockefeller’s Museum of
                  Primitive Art and a comparable stone panel from the same
                  region acquired by Dumbarton Oaks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn11" id="page-koontz-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  In the context of the MFAH, the acquisition of the Classic
                  Maya panel was the beginning for Sweeney’s activities in this
                  area.

                <p>
                  In the following year (1963), the museum mounted a major
                  special exhibition focused on Olmec art entitled
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em>. The show was one of the earliest
                  museum exhibitions in the US or Europe to focus on this
                  singular and fundamental Mesoamerican art tradition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn12" id="page-koontz-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Figure 3 shows the facade of Cullinan Hall during the run of
                  that show, when an original Olmec colossal head (San Lorenzo
                  Monument 2) stood immediately outside the new modernist hall.
                  The interior of the hall was filled with Olmec stone
                  sculpture, much of it borrowed from the Museo de Antropología
                  in Xalapa, Mexico (fig. 4).

                  Focusing on one region of Mesoamerica in an exhibition was an
                  unusual strategy for a US (or European) museum at this time.
                  One reason for this approach might be Sweeney’s known
                  preference for focused shows as opposed to sprawling
                  blockbuster exhibits.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn13" id="page-koontz-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  There were important countervailing forces to the idea of
                  focused exhibitions of ancient American art, however. Large
                  museum exhibitions featuring Mesoamerican art in the US and
                  Europe up to this point had insisted on stitching together a
                  Mexican national tradition, as seen in MoMA’s foundational
                  <em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em> in 1940. The
                  nationalist story is not just a MoMA or even a US penchant:
                  The MFAH archive reveals that, as late as March 1962, Mexican
                  officials were requesting that Sweeney widen the scope of the
                  show to include “other aspects of the development of Mexican
                  art through the Colonial Independence and Modern periods of
                  our country.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn14" id="page-koontz-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  For these correspondents, the nationalist frame had not
                  changed substantially from 1940 and the
                  <em>Twenty Centuries</em> exhibition to the early 1960s. To
                  search for a consistent nonnationalist message in recent
                  ancient American exhibitions (those of the 1950s and early
                  ’60s), one would have to look at smaller, market-driven
                  touring exhibitions like those organized by Stendhal Galleries
                  of Los Angeles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn15" id="page-koontz-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>

                  traveling in Europe in the years immediately preceding
                  Sweeney’s <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> is a relevant case in
                  point. This show used the same nationalist (Mexican) lens seen
                  in the earlier MoMA exhibition to circumscribe the many
                  ancient American cultures in a larger national narrative.
                  Instead of exploring a specific Mesoamerican tradition in
                  depth, the nationalist show surveyed all pre-Conquest
                  traditions found on Mexican soil and then appended the
                  post-Conquest traditions, creating an all-encompassing
                  national art-historical narrative. An ultimate iteration of
                  <em>Masterworks of Ancient Mexican Art</em>, in Los Angeles,
                  also included an Olmec colossal head, San Lorenzo Monument 5,
                  that garnered much attention in the press and with attendees
                  in the same year as Sweeney’s exhibition (1963).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn16" id="page-koontz-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Instead of an exclusive focus on Olmec monumentality and the
                  primacy of Gulf Coast civilization as seen in Sweeney’s show,
                  the head was framed in the LA version of
                  <em>Masterworks</em> as a founding moment in a larger national
                  narrative of Mexican art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1964, the year after the Olmec exhibition, Sweeney again
                  deployed his director’s discretionary funds to acquire
                  important ancient American stone sculptures (<a href="#page-https-emuseum-mfah-org-objects-133477-hieroglyphic-inscription-from-tablet-y-ctx-da188577bd238aedbe3cbf2ac9065d39c047f045-and-idx-0">MFAH 64.38-39</a>). These pieces were related to the Maya panel bought two
                  years earlier in general glyphic style, and it is very likely
                  that all three came from the western Maya region, abutting the
                  Gulf Coast and directly adjacent in space (but not in time) to
                  the material displayed in the Olmec show.

                  In the following year, the art of the ancient Americas takes
                  an important place in the museum’s permanent collection with
                  the gift of approximately two hundred Mesoamerican objects.
                  The donation of Mrs. Harry C. (Alice Nicholson) Hanszen
                  (1900–1977) included the Teotihuacan tripod vase (fig. 5), a
                  Classic Veracruz yoke (fig. 6), and a number of other
                  important pieces. The Hanszen donation contained fine examples
                  of ancient Gulf Coast art but was not limited to that region.
                  With the Hanszen gift as a sort of culmination, it is no
                  exaggeration to say that, after the first four years of
                  Sweeney’s tenure, the ancient American collections of the MFAH
                  had been completely transformed and that this transformation
                  had been driven by the director’s collecting habits and
                  exhibitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the Hanszen collection included objects from across
                  Mesoamerica, the most important initiatives involving ancient
                  American activities during Sweeney’s directorship revolved
                  around the Gulf Coast region of Mesoamerica. It is difficult
                  not to see a strategy of collecting and exhibiting what were
                  viewed at the time as the finest ancient Gulf Coast objects,
                  given the location of Houston and its rising regional
                  prominence. By 1961, the city of Houston was touted in the
                  popular press as one of the Gulf Coast’s largest ports and was
                  soon to be the largest city on the Gulf.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn17" id="page-koontz-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Although the institutional logic of a Gulf Coast thrust is
                  appealing, the archive and Sweeney’s public statements do not
                  indicate that such a regional focus played an important role
                  in his strategy in the early 1960s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While there is little archival evidence of a Gulf Coast
                  strategy, there is more evidence for a strong interest in the
                  larger category of ancient American art by Sweeney and the
                  museum. Sweeney left an alluring but somewhat vague set of
                  public statements on why ancient American art was such a key
                  part of his strategy to improve the profile of the museum. In
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> catalog, Sweeney stated that
                  “because of the closeness of Mexico to Houston, their
                  historical links, their present, close financial associations,
                  as well as Houston’s considerable Mexican population” the
                  museum should focus on the art of the region.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn18" id="page-koontz-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  The art critic Dore Ashton wrote in 1963 that Sweeney thought
                  the pre-Columbian tradition of the Southwest ought to be
                  highlighted in Texas (but leaves “Southwest” undefined).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn19" id="page-koontz-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  A prominent trustee even raised the possibility of the MFAH
                  becoming an “inter-American” museum, quoting Sweeney in this,
                  although little of substance seems to have come of this
                  idea.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn20" id="page-koontz-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  The archive does little to clarify these statements on
                  collecting and exhibiting ancient American art. To better
                  understand Sweeney’s strategy, it may be helpful to see his
                  ancient American strategies in the light of the larger
                  transformations under way at the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Factors at work in the MFAH’s shifting identity in the early
                  1960s include Sweeney’s sense of the future of museums and
                  important exhibitions outlined above and the new architectural
                  envelope that he was called to work on while in Houston (more
                  on this below). Although these factors may be seen as largely
                  extraneous to a knowledge of Mesoamerican art and its regional
                  traditions, they are important to our story because they were
                  of fundamental importance to many of the key actors.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn21" id="page-koontz-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  The incorporation of complex institutional histories into the
                  emergence of ancient American collecting and display requires
                  a larger frame of analysis, one that encompasses prestige
                  competition among museums, contemporary tastes in display
                  strategies, and art market considerations, among other
                  variables. Scholars have long justified this larger frame for
                  the study of early collecting and exhibition strategies in
                  major institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn22" id="page-koontz-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  Museum collections of ancient American art were (and are)
                  often “situated as much in the nexus of the chaos and energy
                  of cultural production as they are representative of rigidly
                  controlled hierarchies of aesthetics and taste,” in the words
                  of Matthew Robb, speaking of the construction of ancient
                  American collections more generally.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn23" id="page-koontz-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  In this case, the ambition for a larger national profile for
                  the MFAH as understood by the director and key trustees, none
                  of whom were versed in the ancient American art-historical
                  discourse, was crucial to the emergence of ancient American
                  art collecting and display in Houston.

                <p>
                  The construction of Cullinan Hall, opened in 1958 and seen
                  above in figures 3 and 4, gave trustees and other stakeholders
                  the feeling that the museum was ready to take its place on the
                  national stage. In relation to earlier construction, the
                  Cullinan was a bold modernist move. The original museum
                  building, finished by 1926, featured a stately neoclassical
                  facade and traditional interiors for the time (fig. 7). An
                  extension of the building in 1953 did little to change the
                  basic architectural character of the museum. Just three years
                  before Sweeney’s arrival, however, Mies van der Rohe’s
                  Cullinan Hall had been added to the original building, adding
                  a soaring interior space along with the modernist facade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is difficult to exaggerate the radical nature of Cullinan
                  Hall’s architecture in Houston at this time. The hall was one
                  extended volume of approximately 10,000 square feet. The
                  ceiling was anchored by steel plate girders that were 5 feet
                  deep and 82 feet long, fanning out to bridge a 30-foot-high
                  interior ceiling. The north facade featured dramatic
                  floor-to-ceiling windows, and a Venetian terrazzo floor
                  effectively grounded the interior space.

                <p>
                  Before Sweeney’s arrival, the critic Eleanor Munro, writing in
                  1959, in <em>ArtNews</em>, distilled the situation for any
                  curator bold enough to step into the space: Cullinan was a
                  “grey-glass walled cell of empty space set as a kind of
                  haughty challenge by architects to the arts of painting and
                  sculpture.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn24" id="page-koontz-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  Sweeney was well aware of the architectural challenge before
                  accepting the director position. On arriving in Houston,
                  Sweeney himself wryly noted, “I have had a little experience
                  with difficult buildings.” This was surely a reference to his
                  recent time at the Guggenheim, overseeing the building and
                  installation in Frank Lloyd Wright’s iconic space, which
                  Sweeney ended up detesting. Sweeney continued about Cullinan
                  Hall: “I admire Mies and find his hall inviting by
                  comparison.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn25" id="page-koontz-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Heroic modernist paintings would enliven the space, alongside
                  the monumental non-Western works that also played well in the
                  hall’s enormous confines. A photograph of the
                  <em>Recent Acquisitions</em> show mounted around the time
                  Sweeney was planning <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> shows the
                  combination of heroic modernist painting (hung from the
                  ceiling by wire!) conversing with recently acquired
                  large-scale Oceanic and African works (fig. 8). Each sculpture
                  was given its own substantial space in the van der Rohe
                  interior. Text was minimized, and each monumental artwork was
                  left to speak for itself.

                  This is the same basic museological approach seen in
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> (see figure 4). We will let the
                  exhibition photograph guide us to an understanding of the
                  basic characteristics of Sweeney’s display strategies: 1) The
                  great plastic sculptural statements of the Olmec are placed on
                  pedestals and plinths; 2) Each object is isolated from the
                  rest and set away from the wall, enhancing the ability of the
                  viewer to experience the works in all their sculptural
                  fullness; 3) Sweeney used no wall text and kept label text to
                  a minimum. The absence of text was, for Sweeney, a point of
                  pride and a call to use one’s critical visual faculties to
                  make sense of the show. Here, Sweeney reveals his program most
                  clearly: Much like his African sculpture exhibition at MoMA
                  almost three decades earlier (<em>African Negro Art</em>,
                  1935), Sweeney focused exclusively on the formal aspects of
                  the non-Western sculpture and eschewed the cultural history
                  surrounding the pieces in both his curatorial strategies and
                  in the catalog that accompanied the exhibition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn26" id="page-koontz-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  Almost thirty years earlier, each large piece was already put
                  on a plinth and given a significant amount of space, and text
                  was minimized. As MFAH curator Alison Greene has noted about
                  Sweeney’s Cullinan installations, “Sweeney celebrated the
                  vastness of the space” in his most important modernist
                  exhibitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn27" id="page-koontz-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  The same celebration of monumental works in the vastness of
                  Cullinan is no less evident in <em>The Olmec Tradition</em>.
                  Looking at Sweeney’s program through the lens of earlier
                  twentieth-century modernist discourse, we can make more sense
                  of Sweeney’s idiosyncratic essay in the exhibition catalog as
                  well, which also eschews any art historical analysis for a
                  tale of the movement of the colossal head and its resurrection
                  against the Cullinan facade—a monumental work worthy of the
                  monumental architectural statement behind.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn28" id="page-koontz-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Inside, Sweeney deployed the smaller but no less monumental
                  Olmec stone sculptures in dialogue with the grand modernist
                  confines of the hall’s interior, with few textual or other
                  impediments to experiencing this visual dialogue. For Sweeney,
                  the single soaring space of Cullinan Hall supported the most
                  emancipatory and heroic modernist painting and sculpture—as
                  well as monumental non-Western sculpture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The architectural historian Stephen Fox has argued that the
                  construction of Cullinan Hall was a bid for a younger
                  generation of the Houston elite to imprint a new emancipatory
                  modernism on the city.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn29" id="page-koontz-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  In Fox’s view of this architectural statement, Miesian
                  modernism eschewed decoration for more transparent
                  construction. It also traded concealed and closed spaces for
                  vast open spaces. In short, the new generation offered a
                  democratically accessible space compared to the exclusion and
                  intimacy of many older museum spaces, including the earlier
                  MFAH building. One can overplay these dichotomous
                  juxtapositions, but there is little doubt that the architect
                  and his Houston patrons felt that Cullinan’s new sense of
                  space was a transformative move for Houston that the new
                  cosmopolitan director was charged with enlivening.

                <p>
                  Cullinan Hall had already hosted a museological coup not long
                  before Sweeney’s arrival: the 1959 show of mainly African art
                  entitled <em>Totem Not Taboo</em>. With an innovative display
                  strategy by Jermayne MacAgy (1914–1964), the favored curator
                  of John and Dominique de Menil, this show was the first to
                  show the possibilities of non-Western sculpture in the space,
                  less than a year after it was completed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn30" id="page-koontz-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Particularly prescient in relation to
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> was the use of stark white
                  pedestals to display large-scale sculpture—in this case,
                  largely African sculpture in wood. However, as Greene
                  observed, “MacAgy subtly tamed the scale of Cullinan Hall” by
                  creating paths and well-defined subareas, while Sweeney
                  celebrated the vastness of the space and the monumental
                  qualities of the art inside, as alluded to above.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn31" id="page-koontz-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                <h2>Indigenous American Art</h2>
                <p>
                  In addition to the usefulness of monumental Olmec sculpture to
                  Sweeney’s modernist project of enlivening Cullinan Hall, there
                  were also considerations of cultural diplomacy at work in
                  early 1960s Houston. Sweeney is clearest on his diplomatic
                  motivations for collecting and exhibiting ancient American art
                  in his contribution to <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> catalog.
                  He begins with a list of elements that bind Houston with
                  Mexico, as noted above. He then lays out a program of
                  exhibitions that will follow: an exhibition of colonial-period
                  objects followed by one on contemporary Mexican art. In his
                  larger hypothetical program, then, Sweeney has returned to the
                  traditional nationalist art- historical paradigm that
                  regulated the exhibition of this material from 1940 onward. He
                  was, however, unable to realize either of these exhibitions
                  while in Houston.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After his programmatic statement on a series of Mexico-focused
                  exhibitions, he turns to a dream of his: to show an Olmec
                  colossal head, like the one he could have seen in the
                  traveling Mexican art shows of the late 1950s in Europe, in
                  relation to the modern facade of Cullinan Hall. Sweeney
                  realized this dream with this exhibition, mixing monumental
                  non-Western art and modern architecture. The rest of his
                  catalog contribution focuses on the voyage of an Olmec head
                  from southern Veracruz to Houston for the opening of the show.

                  In his catalog essay, Sweeney recounts the movement of the
                  head to Houston from Veracruz as a colorful narrative, full of
                  drama.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn32" id="page-koontz-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  Here, Sweeney would allow his long-cultivated literary
                  instincts some play. He describes the letters of support from
                  both the president and vice president of the United States as
                  well as his own voyage into the south Veracruz jungle to
                  inspect the colossal head (fig. 9). He includes his meetings
                  with imminent Mexican archaeologists Alfonso Medellín Zenil
                  and Eusebio Dávalos Hurtado and the subsequent construction of
                  a road more than thirty kilometers long in the region of San
                  Lorenzo for the extraction of the colossal head—a road that
                  also provided robbers with an escape after stealing a key
                  object from the San Lorenzo site museum, as Sweeney notes.
                  Other adventures involved helicopter flights to remote
                  villages as well as the heroic efforts needed to get the head
                  to Coatzacoalcos and onto a ship bound for Houston. Sweeney
                  and the trustees also arranged for the movement of the head
                  from Veracruz to Houston to be filmed and made into a short
                  feature. Photographs from the voyage of the head are featured
                  in Sweeney’s catalog essay. In the catalog and on film, the
                  movement of the head was treated as a heroic coup for the
                  museum.
                </p>
                <h2>Sweeney’s Masculinity and Primitive Art</h2>
                <p>
                  One may ask what a veteran modernist museum director was doing
                  traipsing through the jungles of southern Veracruz and
                  personally overseeing the movement of multi-ton ancient
                  monuments. It would have been easier, one could reasonably
                  argue, to simply ask the Mexican authorities to deliver the
                  head to Houston. The spectacle of discovery in the jungle,
                  however, suited Sweeney’s persona and pleased his MFAH
                  supporters. By this point, Sweeney had spent a lifetime
                  cultivating the trope of the muscular, tenacious modernist
                  critic, from his days on the rugby pitch for Jesus College in
                  the University of Cambridge to the description of the inhuman
                  energy he was able to muster in pursuit of his curatorial and
                  writing projects. The director-as-explorer fit this persona
                  well, and the media had a field day with the journey. The
                  attention certainly raised the profile of the museum,
                  especially in Houston but elsewhere in the country as well,
                  which as we have seen was an important goal for the director
                  and trustees. It is indicative of the importance of this event
                  in Sweeney’s life story that more than thirty years later
                  <em>The New York Times</em> gave considerable column space to
                  the travels of the colossal head and its importance to
                  Sweeney’s public profile in his obituary.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn33" id="page-koontz-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sweeney’s cultivation of this persona may be seen as part of
                  his critical rhetoric as well. The art historian Marcia
                  Brennan has parsed Sweeney’s rhetoric for gendered values and
                  found that for Sweeney, good modern art was robustly plastic
                  and coded masculine, while weak modern art was “decorative”
                  and coded feminine. This gendered coding continued in his
                  approach to art outside the Euro-American tradition, where an
                  appreciation for the right formal qualities—the robust
                  three-dimensionality evident in the Olmec sculptural
                  corpus—allowed modern artists access to the intensity of
                  intuitions that they needed to realize advanced modern
                  works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn34" id="page-koontz-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  For Sweeney, then, these non-Western objects (including
                  ancient American objects) were instrumentalized: They helped
                  modernists develop appropriate and productive (male) plastic
                  conceptions. His was a decidedly formalist approach to the
                  emergence of ancient Mesoamerican art at the MFAH, as it had
                  been for African art earlier at MoMA.

                  Emergence of Sweeney’s Interest in Mesoamerican Art History
                  (1965)
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Sweeney’s deeply formalist approach to curating
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> goes back to his MoMA African art
                  show and his early and important narratives of modernist
                  history. The largely formalist appreciation held for the early
                  Mesoamerican acquisitions as well. There is no record of his
                  sustained interest in the historical context of the Maya
                  panels or other early acquisitions. This situation changes in
                  1965, with the donation of the Hanszen collection of more than
                  two hundred Mesoamerican objects mentioned in the museum’s
                  collecting chronology above. It is in 1965–66 that Sweeney
                  began corresponding with Michael Coe on San Lorenzo Olmec and
                  Gordon Ekholm and Tatiana Proskouriakoff on the meaning and
                  provenience of the Palenque region panel (his first
                  Mesoamerican purchase—see figure 2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn35" id="page-koontz-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Sweeney also commits to a more historical approach in his 1966
                  exhibition <em>Pre-Columbian Art</em>, which used a geographic
                  organizational scheme based on traditional Mesoamerican
                  cultural divisions and chronologies for the 160 pieces
                  displayed, with a catalog essay by Ekholm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn36" id="page-koontz-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the installation of the Hanszen collection exhibition,
                  Sweeney declares in the catalog preface that Houston now stood
                  as one of the premier sites for the appreciation of
                  Mesoamerican, or as he liked to put it, ancient Mexican art,
                  in the United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-koontz-fn37" id="page-koontz-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  The de Menils rewarded these efforts with the donation of a
                  large stone Aztec figure (<a href="#page-https-emuseum-mfah-org-objects-794-standardbearer-ctx-e779d37e79e619d02f89398be951031f31713b40-and-idx-0" target="_blank">MFAH 66.8</a>) during the same year as the Hanszen exhibition. Not long
                  after this donation, it became clear that Sweeney and the
                  trustees were no longer in accord as to the future of the
                  MFAH, and Sweeney stepped down from the directorship in the
                  following year.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The transformation of ancient American collecting and
                  exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, under James
                  Johnson Sweeney was swift and dramatic. The museum went from a
                  place practically devoid of ancient American objects to one
                  which had a wide collection of Mesoamerican objects, with a
                  number of works of international significance. The museum also
                  mounted one of the earliest focused investigations of Olmec
                  art as a major sculptural tradition in its own right. It is
                  likely that the impetus for this transformation was not driven
                  solely or even mainly by the desire to develop excellent
                  collections in this area but instead served institutional
                  desires far beyond Mesoamerican art history. The focus on
                  ancient American art, while new to Sweeney, was originally
                  part of a larger plan of cultural diplomacy between Texas and
                  Mexico. Furthermore, Sweeney saw the development of
                  Mesoamerican collections and especially
                  <em>The Olmec Tradition</em> as a way to highlight the grand
                  exhibition space of Cullinan Hall and activate its exterior.
                  The monumental stone Olmec sculptures worked very well in the
                  hall, as Sweeney knew they would. The spectacular movement of
                  San Lorenzo Monument 2 (the colossal head) through the jungles

                  front of Cullinan Hall’s glass and steel facade created a
                  heroic narrative that served to boost the museum’s regional

                  Studying the rise of pre-Columbian collecting and exhibition
                  in Houston through James Johnson Sweeney’s tenure as the
                  director at the MFAH is an exercise in placing ancient
                  American art amid “the chaos and energy of cultural
                  production” of a museum on the move in the early 1960s. The
                  social lives of these ancient American objects may be seen to
                  take on more breadth as they are allowed to circulate in other
                  conversations, some well outside ancient American art history.
                  Such narratives help illuminate the myriad aesthetic and
                  social forces that ran through these conversations that
                  eventually created the US collections discussed in this
                  volume.

                  The Denver Art Museum (DAM) came into being decades after The
                  Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,
                  and the Art Institute of Chicago. First founded as the Denver
                  Artists’ Club, it would become the Denver Artists Association
                  in 1893, a scant seventeen years after the Colorado territory
                  had become a state. A place to “cultivate a general interest
                  and promotion of the arts,” the museum was powered by
                  volunteers who imbued it with an independent spirit it retains
                  today.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn1" id="page-lyall-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>

                  Denver’s location within the broader geography of the United
                  States plays an outsize role in the institution’s identity and
                  its approach to its collections, audiences, and patrons.
                  Located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, it is surrounded
                  by a vast expanse of land: About eight hundred miles separate
                  it from the next largest global art museum (fig. 1).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn2" id="page-lyall-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  The city sits spitting distance from the center of the
                  country. Because of its geography, the DAM felt a
                  responsibility beyond its immediate surroundings: “What the
                  Metropolitan Museum is to New York, the Art Institute to
                  Chicago, the Louvre to Paris, and the British Museum to
                  London, the Denver Art Museum is to Denver and the whole Rocky
                  Mountain region.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn3" id="page-lyall-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  Today it stands as the largest encyclopedic art museum between
                  Chicago and Los Angeles. Like the other institutions discussed
                  in this volume, early directors, curators, and collectors
                  played an essential role in assembling and shaping the ancient
                  Americas collection. But I would also argue that the museum’s
                  geographic location played an equally significant role. This
                  essay is an exercise in retrieving and reconstructing an often
                  invisible and forgotten history that I hope will remind us of
                  the very human aspect of museums.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1968, then-director Otto Bach (1909–1990) formed the New
                  World Department, which brought together existing Latin
                  American and pre-Columbian material under one umbrella. A
                  collection of southwestern santos donated by an early patron,
                  Anne Evans, and the several hundred works of pre-Columbian
                  objects were recategorized as “New World.” This designation, a
                  phrase borrowed from the writings of European explorers,
                  described the “discovery” of new lands, territories claimed
                  for European empires. Its use was unique within American art
                  museums; at the DAM, it would refer to the territory of the
                  Americas south of the US-Mexico border. Today, the term
                  reminds us of the five-hundred-year colonization and
                  subjugation of American peoples and, rightfully, has been
                  abandoned. The decision in 1968 to use the term to describe a
                  disparate collection of objects united only by their shared
                  geography, however, represented a groundbreaking perspective.
                  It conceptually connected the makers of southwestern santos to
                  the ancient artists of Mexico, Guatemala, and beyond. In fact,
                  Bach’s foresight and those of subsequent curators is what
                  distinguishes Denver’s holdings today: It stands as one of the
                  most expansive and comprehensive collections of the Americas
                  within the United States, capturing the history of the region
                  from the beginning of agriculture to the formation of
                  nineteenth-century republics.

                  Although the department came into being during the midcentury,
                  the heyday of pre-Columbian art, its history begins much
                  earlier. The youngest daughter of Colorado governor John
                  Evans, Anne Evans (1871–1941) was born in London and educated
                  between the mountainous landscape of Colorado and the rarified
                  art collections of Europe and the American East Coast. She
                  studied art at the New York Art Students League and summered
                  at the Evanses’ Colorado ranch.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn4" id="page-lyall-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Evans and her mother devoted themselves to developing
                  Colorado’s cultural sphere, and she would ultimately play a
                  pivotal role in the founding of the Denver Art Museum, serving
                  as the executive secretary, interim director, and ongoing
                  consultant. As the museum took shape, Evans herself began to
                  collect southwestern santos and American Indian art, becoming
                  one of its most ardent promoters. She encouraged the DAM to
                  fund acquisitions, exhibitions, and finally, in 1925, to hire
                  a full-time curator of American Indian art. Upon her death,
                  she donated her entire collection of santos and bultos to the
                  museum (fig. 2). This collection, which showcases the mastery
                  of southwestern wood carvers and painters, draws on both
                  Catholic and Native American imagery, reflecting the region’s
                  and the artists’ own multicultural backgrounds. Through her
                  efforts, Evans ensured the Denver Art Museum’s place as a
                  groundbreaking institution that valued American Indian culture
                  and history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn5" id="page-lyall-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                  It’s difficult to consider Anne’s identity as a collector and
                  promoter of American Indian and southwestern art separate from
                  her father’s legacy. Dr. John Evans, the second territorial
                  governor of Colorado, appointed by Abraham Lincoln, was a
                  physician and railroad titan who would play a hand in the
                  founding of both Northwestern University and University of
                  Denver; however, the Sand Creek Massacre would become his
                  lasting legacy. On November 29, 1864, hundreds of Cheyenne and
                  Arapahoe people were murdered by the US Army. Evans was out of
                  the state on business, but as several studies have concluded,
                  his lack of enforcing Indian treaties and habitual neglect of
                  the Cheyenne and Arapahoe peoples contributed to this
                  tragedy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn6" id="page-lyall-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  His daughter’s efforts to uplift and validate the material
                  culture and aesthetics of Native communities from this region
                  and beyond resulted in the creation of three separate
                  departments at the museum: Native Arts, Ancient Americas, and
                  Latin American Art. One hundred and sixty years later, these
                  collections continue to amplify the stories and voices of
                  Indigenous peoples of the Americas.

                  Frederic “Eric” Douglas (1897–1956), a native Coloradan,
                  joined the museum in 1929 as curator of American Indian art.
                  He would go on to serve the institution for three decades as
                  curator and interim director until his death in 1956.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn7" id="page-lyall-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Douglas was perhaps most well-known for his role in organizing
                  <em>Indian Art of the United States</em>, the 1941 Museum of
                  Modern Art exhibition he cocurated with René d’Harnoncourt,
                  but his true contribution was the establishment of a singular
                  curatorial perspective at the DAM that integrated Native
                  American art into the museum’s fine art collection (fig.
                  3).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn8" id="page-lyall-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Unlike contemporaries around the United States that
                  categorized Indigenous art as “decorative,” Douglas advocated
                  tirelessly for viewing these works on par with that of the
                  great masterpieces of Europe and for the living artists who
                  produced them as individuals possessing a rare skill and
                  expertise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His attitude and character are most clearly captured in his
                  correspondence with the newly appointed director Otto Bach
                  while Douglas was stationed overseas in 1944. Douglas
                  vehemently objected to Bach’s application of the term
                  “primitive” on two accounts. First, by applying the term to
                  the Department of Indian Art, in Douglas’s opinion, Bach
                  lumped the DAM with other museums that had similar
                  departments. Douglas noted that among American art museums,
                  only Denver had “postulated that the American Indian had arts
                  worthy of serious esthetic consideration.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn9" id="page-lyall-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  This objection captures Douglas’s zeal and dedication to the
                  department he had almost single-handedly created and what
                  today we may refer to as his legacy. To his credit, his second
                  objection was: “The use of the word primitive has a
                  connotation of condescension and snobbery both artistic and
                  social. . . . It is a very poor thing to look down our noses
                  however politely at the works of other than our own race,
                  especially if that other is not what is laughingly called
                  white. . . . It’s the wrong use of the word however you look
                  at it and I’ll have no part of it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn10" id="page-lyall-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  In addition to clarifying Douglas’s position, this exchange
                  also provides insight into the fraught relationship between
                  the two men.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Douglas’s extraordinary vision and open-mindedness
                  resulted in the creation of a singular department, he largely
                  ignored historical and contemporary Indigenous peoples living
                  south of the US-Mexico border. Eleanor Roosevelt penned the
                  foreword to <em>Indian Art of the United States</em> and
                  pointedly referenced the interchange of goods and ideas north
                  <em>and</em> south, perhaps a nod to her husband’s promotion
                  of inter-American cooperation; however, Douglas’s
                  correspondence clearly indicates that, in his mind, a bright
                  line separated the two Americas, and he collected exclusively
                  <em>north</em> of the US-Mexico border.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn11" id="page-lyall-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  But when the museum received several gifts of ancient American
                  material, they were administered by the Native Arts department
                  until 1968.

                <h2>Otto Bach: Building a New World</h2>
                <p>
                  <em>Denver Post</em> journalist Bill Hornby wrote an
                  appreciation of Otto Bach after his passing in 1990 and noted:
                  “The man who really put our Art Museum on the world cultural
                  map was Dr. Otto Karl Bach, its director and guiding spirit
                  from 1944–1974. Whether it was in acquiring renowned
                  collections, buying land for expansion, insisting on
                  developing the museum education program for all the people or
                  instilling the tradition that Denver was going to have a world
                  class art collection, Otto and Cile Bach were the driving
                  spirits of the modern Denver Art Museum.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn12" id="page-lyall-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Bach’s thirty-year tenure would transform the museum from a
                  local, provincial institution to one of national renown.
                  Moreover, it would be through Bach and his ministrations that
                  the ancient Americas collection would take shape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bach moved to Denver with his wife, Cile, and their young son
                  from Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1944. In a letter to Douglas
                  introducing himself, Bach explained that his training was in
                  European art, but he had served as a museum administrator for
                  twelve years, first in Milwaukee and later in Grand
                  Rapids.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn13" id="page-lyall-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  His goal, clearly laid out in 1944, was to build a new
                  permanent home for the DAM, which he would achieve in 1971
                  with the opening of the Gio Ponti–designed building.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn14" id="page-lyall-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Somewhere along the way, Bach developed a love for art of the
                  ancient Americas (fig. 4). From his first acquisition in 1951
                  until 1974, when he retired, Bach almost single-handedly built
                  the ancient Americas collection that came to number over one
                  thousand pieces. A museum built on volunteerism, the DAM
                  remained people rich and dollar poor. As a result, Bach would
                  cajole dealers and trade, exchange, buy on credit, and
                  deaccession objects to get the works he wanted.

                <p>
                  In 1956, three months after Douglas’s passing, Dr. Karl Arndt,
                  board president, asked Bach to review the collections in the
                  Native Arts Department with recommendations for culling,
                  keeping, exchanging, and lending.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn15" id="page-lyall-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Bach explained that the American Indian collection consisted
                  of thousands of objects with scores of duplications—some
                  identical: “Mr. Conn and Mr. Bach believe that each category
                  of material should be checked carefully, in small units, with
                  an eye to weeding out duplicates and sub-standard material and
                  replacing it with objects which are of better quality or more
                  uniqueness, or filling in gaps in pre-Columbian, Mexican
                  pre-historic, Mound Builders or other areas which are lacking
                  in representative material.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn16" id="page-lyall-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  As Lewis Story, DAM’s assistant director at the time,
                  observed, Bach’s decision to further develop collections of
                  African, Oceanic, and pre-Columbian holdings allowed him to
                  serve “a multicultural constituency more effectively.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn17" id="page-lyall-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Over the next several years, Bach would work to drum up
                  support via the museum’s various affiliated committees
                  specifically to acquire ancient Americas objects. Here, in
                  this image from a 1959 board report, Bach proudly stands with
                  the chairwoman of the Women’s Committee, who contributed funds
                  to acquire the ceramic head (fig. 5).

                  As other authors in this volume note, America at midcentury
                  was captivated by the ancient Americas (see essays by Rosoff,
                  Koontz, and Robb). A steady stream of exhibitions traveled
                  around the country, or were organized locally, to showcase the
                  wonders of “lost” or “mysterious” civilizations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn18" id="page-lyall-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Beginning in 1950, Bach worked to bring many of these shows to
                  Denver. Exhibitions featuring Middle American gold, ancient
                  Peruvian artwork, and “Pre-Columbian and Contemporary Art”
                  began appearing in the Schleier Memorial Gallery with some
                  frequency between 1950 and 1960 (fig. 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn19" id="page-lyall-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  During the run of the exhibitions, Bach befriended the dealers
                  and collectors who lent work to the shows, ultimately securing
                  one or two pieces for the DAM’s growing collection. The
                  museum’s annual reports began featuring names such as Julius
                  Carlebach and Earl Stendahl.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn20" id="page-lyall-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Additionally, Bach, ever the promoter, penned short articles
                  for <em>The Denver Post</em>, celebrating the acquisition of
                  pre-Columbian objects at the museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn21" id="page-lyall-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  While Bach acquired these works through trades and exchanges,
                  these acquisitions provoked the ire of the board.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn22" id="page-lyall-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  These transactions became so prevalent that, during one
                  contentious board meeting in 1967, a trustee lamented the
                  number of times he went to the gallery and realized a beloved
                  piece was missing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn23" id="page-lyall-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  He called for greater transparency for trades and exchanges.
                  Unfortunately, his words were not heeded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bach continued growing the collection of art from the Americas
                  incrementally. By 1967, there were 153 pre-Columbian works in
                  the DAM’s collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn24" id="page-lyall-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  In 1968, he decided to join the pre-Columbian objects from
                  Mexico and Central and South America with Anne Evans’s
                  southwestern santos collection to officially create the New
                  World Department. With this new arrangement, the story of the
                  art of the Americas could now be seen sequentially, connecting
                  the ancient with the more recent past.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn25" id="page-lyall-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>

                  Bach hired Robert Stroessner (1942–1991), who received a
                  degree in interior design from the University of Denver, as
                  the inaugural New World curator (fig. 7). An assistant curator
                  in Native Arts under Norman Feder, Stroessner had been Bach’s
                  student and protégé and, like Bach, understood the history of
                  the Americas as part of a single continuum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn26" id="page-lyall-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  He took pride in Denver’s regional approach, writing to donors
                  that the museum’s decision to include both ancient and
                  colonial art from Latin America under the same umbrella was
                  unusual. In a 1974 letter to the new director, Tom Maytham,
                  Stroessner underscored the New World Department’s unique
                  approach: “We have tried to systematically select
                  representative examples to form a chain of pieces which link
                  as many historical connections as possible through the entire
                  history of Latin America.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn27" id="page-lyall-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  In a separate letter to collector and patron Olive Bigelow
                  Pell, he lamented that the most important collections of this
                  material live in natural history or folk art museums,
                  underscoring the uniqueness of the DAM’s approach and the
                  importance it played modeling an innovative approach for its
                  peers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn28" id="page-lyall-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Noted for his charm and panache, Stroessner forged
                  relationships across the United States and Latin America.
                  Though 1968 was late to be assembling a collection of
                  pre-Columbian art and with few funds at his disposal,
                  Stroessner, like Bach before him, relied on partnerships,
                  museum exchanges, and creative funding. Three collectors
                  played significant roles in building the pre-Columbian
                  holdings: Morton “Buster” May and Mr. and Mrs. Frederick
                  Mayer.

                  The grandson of David May, a German Jewish émigré who settled
                  in Colorado in 1877, Morton, known as “Buster,” assumed the
                  chairmanship of the May Company department store conglomerate
                  in 1951. While Morton May was born in St. Louis, his roots
                  were in Leadville, Colorado. David May moved his family from
                  Ohio to Leadville for health reasons and established a dry
                  goods supply for the region’s miners.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn29" id="page-lyall-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  Two years after his arrival, the Leadville mine struck silver,
                  and by 1880, the town had grown to nearly thirty thousand
                  people. Eventually, May would purchase another store in Denver
                  in 1887, and by 1911 the May Department Stores would be a
                  publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.
                  Despite the family’s relocation to St. Louis, the Mays
                  remained a part of Colorado’s Jewish community.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn30" id="page-lyall-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  David May helped found the Hebrew Benevolent Association in
                  Leadville and maintained the town’s synagogue (fig. 8).

                  In 1957, the May Company purchased the Daniels and Fischer
                  store on 16th Street in downtown Denver. Known locally as May
                  D&amp;F, the store became a city fixture. Located on
                  Zeckendorff Plaza, the campus included a pavilion shaped like
                  a hyperbolic paraboloid, designed by architect I. M. Pei and
                  an artificial ski slope during the winter months (fig. 9). The
                  structure was destroyed to make way for a pedestrian street
                  mall.

                  A collector of primitive art, May arrived in Denver just as
                  Otto Bach was trying to rally support for a world-class
                  collection of pre-Columbian art. Indeed, the entirety of May’s
                  documented relationship with the DAM transpired during the
                  course of Bach’s tenure: His earliest gift happened in 1946
                  and his last in 1971.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn31" id="page-lyall-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  May donated extensively to the Native Arts Department,
                  corresponding with the department’s curator, Norman Feder, and
                  connecting Feder with other collectors and dealers that
                  reached out to May but were not of interest to him.

See this exhibition beginning tomorrow in the downtown store, second floor gallery.  Approximately 2,000 pieces have been selected and purchased under the personal supervision of Mr. Morton D.

Sawyer, Director of the Textile Museum, Washington D.C. Dr. Henry B. Nicholson, Associate Professor of Anthropology, UCLA expertised the Mexican stone pieces.  There is a wealth of art from Mexico and Peru interspersed with pieces from Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador. Many of the pieces have been determined to be of excellent museum quality. Viewing this collection of art from about 900 BC through the fifteenth century is an adventure for anyone. Pottery is in abundance in human and animal shapes. Stone, wood, gold and other metals are represented. Particularly outstanding is a collection of jade, stone and metal jewelry. Ancient Peruvian textiles are a strong part of the exhibition which ranges in price from $5 to $8,000. The art of Central America and the West Coast of South America, dating before Columbus’ discovery of America, has long been recognized as one of the highest artistic achievements of man. It is perhaps the favorite art form of people in this Rocky Mountain Empire, because of the early Spanish heritage of the land and because of the excellent collection in the pre-Columbian gallery in the south wing, Denver Museum of Art.

                  As Matthew Robb’s essay in this volume makes clear, May’s
                  formation as a commercial businessman influenced how he viewed
                  his collections: as commodities that would be bought and sold.
                  This prompted the development of a touring art sale that would
                  visit May Company stores in Saint Louis, Denver and,
                  ultimately, Los Angeles (fig. 10). James Economos, May’s
                  curator and consultant for the art sale, corresponded with
                  curators at institutions nationwide. Economos, May, and the
                  Textile Museum’s curator, Alan Sawyer, were photographed in
                  the courtyard of the May Company’s Wilshire Boulevard
                  department store, and the brazier in Economos’s hand (DAM
                  1990.70) ended up in the DAM collection via the Los Angeles
                  dealer Earl Stendahl (see figure 7 in Robb).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn32" id="page-lyall-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  In 1969, Morton May gifted the DAM thirteen pieces of
                  Mesoamerican art in honor of David S. Touff, who retired as
                  the May Company board chairman that year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn33" id="page-lyall-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Between 1968 and 1971, May and the Denver branch of May
                  D&amp;F were frequent donors to the DAM’s nascent New World
                  Department, directly gifting the museum over fifty individual
                  works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn34" id="page-lyall-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In fact, in Bach’s obituary, then board chair Frederick Mayer
                  recalled how he, May, and Bach worked together to build the
                  ancient Americas collection and create the New World
                  Department: “Buster May of the May Co. department stores had a
                  large collection of Peruvian pre-Columbian pieces and Otto
                  pestered him for years to get the collection for DAM. . . .
                  Buster always told him the pieces were for sale not donation.
                  . . . Finally, the store decided to get rid of the collection
                  and Bach negotiated a price of 30,000 for 800 Peruvian pots
                  and textiles.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn35" id="page-lyall-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  The acquisition was more complex than this and included a
                  substantial gift by Frederick and Jan Mayer to the museum.
                  May’s collection numbered 1,300 works of ancient Peruvian art.
                  May was willing to sell the collection to the DAM at a
                  discounted price, but the museum lacked the necessary funds.
                  Frederick Mayer purchased the entire collection and gifted
                  sixty-two pieces, selected by Bach and Stroessner, to the DAM.
                  Forty-four pieces went to a Texas collector, and the remaining
                  objects were gifted or sold.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn36" id="page-lyall-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  The Andean material included in this acquisition may have come
                  from the enormous Peruvian collection assembled by Dr. Edouard
                  Gaffron and acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago (see
                  Elizabeth Pope, this volume), parts of which had been
                  deaccessioned and purchased by Morton May.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn37" id="page-lyall-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  This complicated transaction, which began in 1969 and was
                  completed in 1970, became one of the New World Department’s
                  foundational collections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn38" id="page-lyall-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>

                  By 1969, the New World collection had grown sufficiently to
                  occupy dedicated galleries in the new Ponti building, which
                  opened to the public in 1971. Stroessner used his background
                  in interior design to present the newly enlarged collection in
                  dramatic installations, winning over patrons and visitors
                  alike. Large-scale maquettes of Uxmal’s Magician’s Pyramid
                  (fig. 11) and a Maya-period room (fig. 12), complete with
                  painted moss, evoked the magnificence of the material for
                  Denver audiences.

                  Stroessner’s greatest contribution, however, would be the
                  cultivation of a young couple from Texas, Frederick and Jan
                  Mayer, who would go on to endow the department (fig.13). The
                  Mayers were early supporters of Stroessner and eventually
                  became the department’s most significant donors. From an early
                  age, Frederick had collected Costa Rican stamps and had been
                  interested in Central America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn39" id="page-lyall-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  In 1966, he and his wife vacationed in Costa Rica. “In those
                  days,” he recalled, “there were stores that sold pre-Columbian
                  artifacts.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn40" id="page-lyall-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  The couple focused their collecting on art from this region in
                  an effort to assemble a comprehensive collection of ancient
                  Costa Rican art. Mayer would enlist the help of archaeologists
                  and students to not only find works but to promote the
                  investigation and understanding of the region’s development.
                  Mayer’s intellectual curiosity knew no bounds, and he
                  collected with almost scientific precision. Like May, he
                  amassed all examples of a given style, period, or type, in
                  this case, ceramics, greenstone, and metallurgy from the Costa
                  Rican region. The size and comprehensiveness of the collection
                  gave it an inestimable educational value for scholars of
                  Central America. During the 1980s and ’90s, the Mayers funded
                  numerous studies, symposia, and exchanges between Costa Rican
                  and American students and scholars. Frederick served as
                  Chairman of the Board of Trustees for many years, and his
                  generosity was not limited to the department or even to the
                  DAM.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn41" id="page-lyall-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>

                  Beginning in the early 1990s, a large portion of the Mayers’
                  collection of three thousand pieces were placed with the
                  museum on long-term loan and were featured prominently in the
                  department’s re-installed galleries, which opened in 1993 in
                  time for the museum’s centennial.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn42" id="page-lyall-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  The new installation, geared toward scholars, dedicated nearly
                  half of the floor space to study storage. Seven
                  cruciform-shaped glass cases displayed nearly 90 percent of
                  the ancient Americas collection. Arranged from Inca to the
                  Olmec, the cases displayed many of the works flat on shelves
                  with maps and other didactic material available on the
                  perimeter walls (fig. 14). The arrangement permitted the
                  viewing and comparison of pieces often relegated to storage
                  that the public could not access.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Mayers funded the creation of a Center for Pre-Columbian
                  and Spanish Colonial Art in 2001, the second and successful
                  iteration of such a center. The earlier version, the Center
                  for the Study of Latin American Art and Archaeology, had been
                  staffed by archaeologists, Gordon McEwan, an Andean
                  specialist, and Fred W. Lange, an assistant professor at the
                  University of Colorado, Boulder, who focused on Mayer’s region
                  of interest, Central America. McEwan had been appointed New
                  World curator after Stroessner’s passing in 1991 and oversaw
                  the 1993 reinstallation; he left the museum in 1997. Dorie
                  Reents-Budet served as interim curator for two years,
                  <a href="#page-https-d26jxt5097u8sr-cloudfront-net-2023-03-10-2027-201998-20repatriation-20of-20el-20zotz-20lintel-20to-20guatemala-pdf" target="_blank">overseeing the restitution of a wooden Maya lintel from El
                    Tzotz to the National Museum of Guatemala</a>. Finally in 2001, the DAM decided to split the New World
                  Department into two separate collections overseen by dedicated
                  specialists. Margaret Young-Sánchez became the curator of
                  pre-Columbian art and Donna Pierce the curator of Spanish
                  colonial art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Young-Sánchez and Pierce, together, shaped what would become
                  the Mayer Center. Both curators added significantly to their
                  respective collections, enhancing the breadth and quality of
                  the New World Department.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn43" id="page-lyall-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  While both organized impactful international exhibitions,
                  <em>Tiwanaku</em> (2002) and
                  <em>Painting a New World</em> (2004), arguably their greatest
                  contribution was shaping the identity and vision of the Mayer
                  Center and its associated activities. The Center’s purpose
                  was, and remains, to increase awareness and promote
                  scholarship in these fields by sponsoring academic activities,
                  including symposia, fellowships, conservation, and
                  publications. The generosity of the Mayers ensured that the
                  symposia could bring together scholars from across the world,
                  galvanizing conversations across disciplines and institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By 2017, the DAM hired two new curators to succeed
                  Young-Sánchez and Pierce, Jorge Rivas Pérez and myself.
                  Together, we decided to revamp tradition by considering the
                  relevance of our respective collections to present
                  communities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn44" id="page-lyall-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  As we entered the museum’s next phase, the reinstallation of
                  the permanent collection galleries, we reevaluated the
                  antiquated terms used to describe our collections and
                  reaffirmed our commitment to promoting art of the Americas,
                  replacing “pre-Columbian” and “Spanish colonial” with “ancient
                  American” and “Latin American.” While the ancient Americas
                  collection primarily focuses on objects produced during the
                  four thousand years of civilization preceding the Spanish, its
                  expanded scope includes works by contemporary artists whose
                  practice or technique resonates with those of ancient artists.

                  The reinstallation, completed in 2021, no longer includes the
                  study storage cases (fig. 15). The glass shelves that
                  showcased so many objects intimidated visitors and were
                  replaced with a color-coded presentation structured around
                  geography (Mesoamerica, Central America, and South America)
                  and three central ideas: land, legacy, and trade. The question
                  of “land” addresses the impact that environment, geography,
                  and landscape have on our understanding of the world and our
                  place in it. From volcanoes to mangroves and coastal deserts,
                  the varied landscapes of the Americas played a powerful role
                  in the narratives and cosmovision of peoples across the
                  continent. “Legacy” considers how the past continues to shape
                  the present. The images, shapes, forms, and materials of
                  ancient artists persist in the work of contemporary artists
                  and the visual vocabulary of descendant communities on both
                  sides of the border. Finally, the concept of “trade” addresses
                  the continual exchange of goods and ideas that linked ancient
                  communities across time and space. Recent scholarship has
                  underscored the sophistication of ancient navigation and
                  technological innovation that permitted connections to be made
                  across vast, previously unimaginable, distances.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-lyall-fn45" id="page-lyall-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>

                  approach of the early curators who respected and regarded in

                  Americas. Bach and Stroessner’s vision for a holistic approach
                  that presented the historical and artistic complexity of the
                  region across time has likewise left an indelible mark. But
                  perhaps the strongest influence for the ancient Americas
                  collection at present is the relationship to the descendant
                  communities locally, nationally, and internationally that seek
                  solace and connection in the works of ancient artists.

                        In the director’s report delivered during a 1967 April
                        board meeting, Bach discussed recent museum accessions,
                        all in the field of pre-Columbian art. Since accession
                        funds were zero and had been since the Development Fund
                        campaign started, the only way to keep the collection
                        alive was to trade or exchange material. In this case,
                        Bach traded or exchanged duplicate prints from the
                        museum’s collection in order to acquire an early
                        Peruvian cup (<a href="#page-https-www-denverartmuseum-org-en-object-1967-107" target="_blank">1967.107</a>), a rare Nayarit village Dance (1967.109), a small and
                        costly Maya figure (1967.108), a Costa Rican incense
                        burner representing the crocodile god (deaccessioned), a
                        Costa Rican animal effigy jar (deaccessioned), a
                        snake-headed jar (deaccessioned), and a ceremonial
                        metate in the shape of a jaguar (deaccessioned). Board

                        Mr. Billmyer, a member of the board, offered “random
                        thoughts and questions” regarding the museum’s Accession
                        Committee during the meeting held on May 24, 1967. He
                        asked whether the DAM should continue to be a collecting
                        institution, “since it is always suffering from a lack
                        of acquisition funds.” And he personally deplored the
                        idea of “trading,” so he asked for a published statement
                        regarding the museum’s policy and purpose of acquiring
                        art objects. Board Meeting, May 24, 1967, ibid.

                        This figure was compiled by reviewing the annual reports
                        and inventory of objects included for each department.
                        Because of the chaotic nature of trades and exchanges
                        that did not always leave a legible trace in the
                        collections record, we found these lists to be more
                        reliable. In the 1967 Annual Report, New World appears
                        as one of the departments, but no specific works are
                        listed.

                        Ibid. A memo listing museum staff in March 1968 notes
                        that the institution employed thirty-three people as
                        staff and lists Robert Stroessner as Assistant Curator
                        of American Indian Art. Annual Meeting Minutes 1968–69,
                        D13.FB2, Denver Art Museum Archives. While born in
                        Colorado, Robert Stroessner’s family had connections to
                        Latin America. A part of Stroessner’s family emigrated
                        from Germany to Colorado, while another branch moved to
                        Paraguay. Alfredo Stroessner, Paraguay’s longtime
                        dictator, was Robert’s granduncle. The family remained
                        in contact with their South American relatives.
                        Stroessner visited Paraguay, and on at least on one
                        occasion, his granduncle visited the US. See La Hay
                        Wauhillau, “Denver’s Stroessner Rub Shoulders with
                        President,” <em>The Denver Post</em>, March 21, 1968. It
                        is not known, however, how much Robert or his parents
                        knew of his granduncle’s activities in the country. See

                        become storage for unused vitrines and museum furniture

                        In this history of the Mayers’ involvement with the DAM,
                        this gift stands out for its financial complexity. It is
                        worth noting that there is no evidence that the Mayers
                        ever performed such fiscal feats again to bring a
                        collection to the museum. Given the timing of the
                        exchange, I would speculate that May, a successful
                        businessman fourteen years Mayer’s senior, may have
                        exerted a certain influence on the nature of the
                        purchase and the eventual gift.

                        Young-Sánchez broadened the collection geographically

                  In the 1960s and 1970s, the Tucson Museum of Art found new
                  clarity in defining a vision of its future. After decades of
                  operating without a permanent collection, doing business under
                  various organizational names, and mounting an eclectic range
                  of exhibitions in rented quarters, the museum began to push
                  for a building of its own and to plan for an art collection,
                  and what was then called “pre-Columbian art” was foregrounded
                  as central to its purpose. Reporting on a gift of funds to
                  construct the new galleries, the
                  <em>Arizona Daily Star</em> noted that “the new museum is
                  expected to feature permanent collections of pre-Columbian,
                  Spanish Colonial, and contemporary Western art,” observing the
                  special relationship between the museum’s collection-to-be and
                  Tucson’s identity as a place of Mexican heritage.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn1" id="page-driggers-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Museum leadership believed that Tucson’s history should guide
                  their acquisitions, and the art of the Americas—and especially
                  ancient and colonial art from Mexico—became the institution’s
                  foremost priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This plan and mission for a new museum, however, were born
                  within a complex political and social reality. Tucson in the
                  1960s was a city in transition. Policies were enacted that
                  would fundamentally change the identity of downtown, where the
                  museum’s campus would ultimately be built. An urban renewal
                  plan, approved by Tucsonans in the mid-1960s, would condemn
                  and clear the neighborhood known as <em>la calle</em>, where
                  Mexican Americans and Mexicans had built a busy and culturally
                  connective commercial and residential district. In its place,
                  city leaders envisioned that new cultural spaces would
                  “modernize” Tucson, reconfiguring city blocks to eliminate
                  these homes and businesses and displace their residents. In
                  short order, the new museum, with its mission of collecting
                  Tucson’s Mexican past, would come to occupy a space within
                  that urban renewal footprint.

                  Tucson is a Borderlands place, and because of this, new
                  initiatives can only intervene within a landscape that has
                  been multiply reinscribed across the region’s deep
                  history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn2" id="page-driggers-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Tucson is on the ancestral territory of Indigenous Sonoran
                  Desert communities. Southern Arizona was not part of a US
                  state but a territory until 1912, remaining so for more than
                  sixty years after California’s statehood, and it was Mexican
                  territory until the Gadsden Purchase of 1854. The city is only
                  an hour’s drive north of the border, and its built environment
                  and visual culture through the mid-twentieth century were
                  defined by Tucson’s relationship to Mexico. The Presidio,
                  built to house New Spain’s armies, once anchored the city
                  center, and in the surrounding neighborhoods, Sonoran-style
                  adobe structures housed downtown Tucson residents and
                  businesses. For all these reasons and more, Arizona historians
                  suggest that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
                  centuries, Tucson was largely perceived as Arizona’s “Mexican”
                  town—unlike Phoenix, where Spanish and Mexican armies never
                  settled and where anti-Mexican attitudes precluded what one
                  scholar described as Tucson’s unmatched “bicultural
                  vitality.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn3" id="page-driggers-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, many art museums across the country are increasingly
                  attentive to amplifying the resonances between the objects
                  that they steward and their local contexts. For institutions
                  that collect ancient American art, collections are
                  increasingly activated in collaboration with local Latinx and
                  Indigenous communities and their histories. At the time of the
                  collection’s founding, Tucson Museum of Art leadership
                  imagined that they would build a collection tied to regional
                  histories, acquiring works intentionally for their ties to
                  local people and place. Even so, closely attending to the
                  historical conditions in which that collection was formed
                  traces a more nuanced story about the relationship between the
                  museum and community. Most recently, this history also
                  includes initiatives in which the museum has sought to chart a
                  path forward in new, inclusive relationships with communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Turning momentarily to the first person: I worked at Tucson
                  Museum of Art as curator of the Latin American collections
                  from 2019 to 2024, where my colleagues and I were sensitive to
                  both the unique circumstances of the museum and the
                  distinctive relationship of the institution to its local
                  context. The museum is different in key ways from the other
                  institutions whose histories are studied in this volume. Its
                  collecting began relatively late, with the first acquisitions
                  of ancient American art coming only in 1965. It has never been
                  an encyclopedic museum, and so the ancient American
                  collections have never been asked to justify their importance
                  relative to other global ancient traditions. There are also
                  operational differences: The museum’s campus is small, its
                  staff lean, its resources modest. Yet even given these
                  differences, the Tucson Museum of Art’s history is important
                  to the broader picture of how ancient American art has been
                  collected and exhibited in art museums in the United States.
                  Its history tells how stewarding ancient American art became
                  entangled in a city’s broader renegotiation of its own
                  identity as a place of Mexican history, heritage, and culture.

                <h2>
                  Ancient American Art in Tucson Before the Tucson Museum of Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Long before the Tucson Museum of Art began acquiring objects
                  for its permanent collection, Tucsonans maintained broad
                  popular interest in the ancient Americas and in their city’s
                  relationship to the Mesoamerican past. The origins of the
                  connections between southern Arizona and Mesoamerica run deep.
                  Iconography from historical pottery of the Southwest shows
                  that by the 1300s, Indigenous artists of southern Arizona
                  created imagery representing ideologies shared with
                  Mesoamerican peoples, with common ideas and images circulating
                  beyond the delimitations of contemporary national borders.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn4" id="page-driggers-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Today, Indigenous collaborators in Tucson Museum of Art
                  curatorial projects continue to affirm ties between
                  southwestern heritage and ancient American visual cultures,
                  recognizing a common heritage in Mesoamerican art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Newspaper records of the early twentieth century show that
                  English-language audiences were interested in Tucson’s ties to
                  Mesoamerica—though the most spectacular account in this early
                  history was rooted in an archaeological fraud. In 1924, a
                  trove of lead crosses, swords, and other artifacts was
                  discovered by the city’s deputy sheriff while he explored a
                  lime kiln near a wash a few miles from downtown. Dozens of
                  additional objects were soon uncovered, several of which were
                  inscribed with Latin texts that were later proven to be
                  haphazard copies lifted from the classics. For years, local
                  authorities speculated that the artifacts might prove that
                  Tucson was the meeting place for ancient Toltec and Roman
                  soldiers, and no less a figure than George Vaillant
                  (1901–1945), then curator at Harvard’s Peabody Museum, was
                  brought to inspect the find site.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn5" id="page-driggers-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  The question of their authenticity was at last debunked by
                  1930, but the forgeries effectively generated years of local
                  interest in Tucson’s ties to Mesoamerica and the broader
                  world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, Americanist archaeology played a significant role in
                  defining the regional identity of Tucson in the 1930s. In the
                  words of one reporter writing in the
                  <em>Tucson Daily Citizen</em> in 1937, “One of the strongest
                  lures of the Southwest is the historically fascinating field
                  it offers to the archaeologically minded. Not only does this
                  region provide limitless resources to the scientist, but the
                  layman is ever conscious of the ‘great discoveries’ as is
                  demonstrated by the many bones, pieces of pottery and other
                  objects which are turned into the State Museum for
                  inspection.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn6" id="page-driggers-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  Popular media brought news of excavations carried out in
                  Pueblo archaeology in northeastern Arizona, while the Arizona
                  State Museum in Tucson processed accumulations of scientific
                  and informally excavated materials.

                  While Tucsonans’ interest in the archaeology of the ancient
                  Americas is clearly attested in the early decades of the
                  twentieth century, sources on ancient art’s commercialization
                  during the same years are relatively quiet. By midcentury,
                  however, several galleries that specialized in ancient
                  American art operated in the city. Sheep rancher Clay Lockett
                  (ca. 1906/1907–1984) opened his Indian Arts and Crafts shop in
                  1942, marketing ancient American art and works in other
                  collecting categories to a Hollywood clientele. A photograph
                  documents a visit by actor Ralph Bellamy (1904–1991), who is
                  shown holding an ostensibly pre-Columbian ceramic work that he
                  purchased at the gallery (fig. 1). Oral histories recall that
                  noted collector Vincent Price (1911–1993) also paid a visit to
                  Lockett in search of ancient gold objects in the early
                  1960s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn7" id="page-driggers-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lockett was not alone in selling pre-Columbian art in
                  midcentury Tucson. Promotional announcements for galleries now
                  long defunct evidence the active trade in ancient American
                  artworks in the city. At a gallery called Shearman-Sierk,
                  photographs from 1962 document an installation in which west
                  Mexican sculptures hung alongside paintings by local artists
                  in the gallery’s inaugural exhibition, designed by the
                  University of Chicago–trained art historian Richard
                  Pelham-Keller.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn8" id="page-driggers-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Another gallery, America West Primitive and Modern Art, sold
                  pre-Columbian art under the direction of Tucson-born Princeton
                  graduate Kelley Rollings (1927–2018), who also offered works
                  in other categories to meet local interest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn9" id="page-driggers-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Also in town was Catherine Noble’s Mexican Shop, where 1956
                  saw a sale of “effigies and bowls recently brought back from
                  the Nayarit district.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn10" id="page-driggers-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  Decades later, the proprietors of several of these local
                  galleries would play a pivotal role in growing the museum’s
                  collection: Both Lockett and Rollings would donate to the
                  museum’s Latin American holdings, with Rollings gifting
                  Mesoamerican works to the growing collection in the 1970s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn11" id="page-driggers-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                </p>

                  Cumulatively, available sources suggest that in midcentury
                  Tucson, ancient American objects were largely marketed and
                  displayed as part of a cross-category decorative collecting
                  practice, bought and sold alongside what today we distinguish
                  as colonial Latin American art, Indigenous southwestern works,
                  Latin American folk art, and even art of the American West.
                  Interior photographs of Tucson homes suggest how consumers in
                  this market displayed these works together. Images show
                  ancient American objects like Nayarit figural sculpture
                  displayed alongside Mexican silver in colonial styles and
                  Indigenous historic pottery from the US Southwest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn12" id="page-driggers-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  The cross-category mingling of ancient American objects
                  reflected in such collection photos mirrors their movement
                  through the market.

                  In the same years when Tucson dealers and purchasers shaped a
                  collecting practice for the region, Tucson-area institutions
                  were also defining serious scholarly commitments to scientific
                  study of ancient Mexico. New learnings from these projects
                  identified scientific bases for shared histories between
                  Mesoamerica and the Southwest. East of the city, the Amerind
                  Foundation’s director, Charles Di Peso (1920–1982), was
                  engaged in excavations at Paquimé, Chihuahua, from the late
                  1950s into the 1960s in partnership with Mexico’s INAH
                  (Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia). Di Peso’s
                  excavations established that Paquimé was a point of
                  high-volume trade between Mesoamerica and the Southwest, a
                  place where scarlet macaws from Mesoamerica were husbanded in
                  the Chihuahua desert.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn13" id="page-driggers-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  More broadly, the Amerind’s projects were staking out a vision
                  in which Arizona and New Mexico might be posited as
                  Mesoamerica’s northernmost expression.

                  The local conditions described thus far—gallery sales of
                  pre-Columbian art, a decorative style incorporating ancient
                  American objects, extensive local reporting in the popular
                  press on Arizona Americanist archaeology, and archaeological
                  excavations tying the Southwest to Mesoamerica—all had a part
                  in defining Tucson’s relationship to the ancient Americas. Yet
                  none of this might necessarily have led to the creation of a
                  local museum collection of ancient American art. There was,
                  after all, no clear space for such a collection. The
                  University of Arizona Museum of Art had been energized in 1951
                  by a gift of Renaissance paintings from the Samuel H. Kress
                  Foundation; meanwhile, its civic analog, the Tucson Fine Arts
                  Association, which would later become the Tucson Museum of
                  Art, would not begin collecting in any category until 1959.
                  But that first gift would come from Frederick Rhodes Pleasants
                  (1906–1976), a prodigious collector, curator, and heritage
                  worker who became a leading force in the city’s cultural
                  sector (fig. 2). Singly, Pleasants would become the figure
                  most responsible for the institutionalization of ancient
                  American art history in the city.

                  Frederick R. Pleasants and the Founding of the Tucson Museum
                  of Art Collection
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Before arriving in Tucson, taking a position at the University
                  of Arizona to enjoy the health benefits of the desert,
                  Pleasants had developed a multifaceted career in museums and
                  heritage work. Trained at Princeton University as a specialist
                  in Maya art and archaeology, Pleasants organized exhibitions
                  at Harvard’s Peabody Museum in the 1930s, where a report from
                  the institution states that one display on the Americas
                  emphasized “the effect of environment on culture.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn14" id="page-driggers-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  World War II brought Pleasants to issues of restitution: As a
                  Monuments Man, he was appointed to head the Central Collecting
                  Point in Munich in 1946. His return from the war also brought
                  him back to the Peabody, and then to the Brooklyn Museum,
                  where he succeeded Herbert Spinden (1879–1967) as Curator of
                  Primitive Art from 1949 to 1956.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn15" id="page-driggers-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the Brooklyn years, Pleasants organized exhibitions
                  that perhaps best speak to his vision of the field. In a short
                  bulletin published by the museum, he laid out a plan for the
                  department that distinguished between what he termed “objects
                  of art” and “objects of anthropology.” Brooklyn would pay most
                  attention to art, with the purpose of working to “demonstrate
                  the special contribution of primitive art, its closeness to
                  technical processes, and its strongly motivated social
                  background as well as showing the best from an aesthetic
                  viewpoint.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn16" id="page-driggers-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  In his galleries, Pleasants grouped Aztec works with African
                  and Oceanic objects to suggest that all works had social
                  motivations. Visually, he pursued what he described as
                  “experimental display techniques” with modern lighting and
                  harmonious color schemes. A bibliographic note tells us that
                  in 1954, Pleasants spoke at a Wenner-Gren Foundation Supper
                  Conference alongside Alfred Kidder (1885–1963) and Linton
                  Sattherthwaite Jr. (1897–1978) where the topics included,
                  among other things, “The Role and Function of Museums,”
                  “Problems of Exhibition,” and “The Potentialities of
                  Television.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn17" id="page-driggers-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Alongside his museum work, Pleasants was also building a
                  personal collection. By his own account, he was motivated to
                  collect “primarily for teaching purposes,” an assertion that
                  aligns with his relatively pedagogical approach to presenting
                  museum galleries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn18" id="page-driggers-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  The timeline and methods of his acquisitions, however, remain
                  obscure. By 1938, Pleasants’s name would be recorded as a
                  purchaser in the Brummer Gallery records, and in 1944, Brummer
                  sold Pleasants a Moche vessel now in Tucson’s collection (fig.
                  3). A textile in a hybrid Moche-Wari style (<a href="#page-https-tucsonmuseumofart-pastperfectonline-com-webobject-196f19a8-4d18-11d9-bd9a-016751224300" target="_blank">2001.23.1</a>), also now at the museum, was almost certainly owned
                  previously by one of Pleasants’s Brooklyn contacts, the German
                  Peruvian dealer Guillermo Schmidt Pizarro (1880–1964), who
                  sold a related work to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in the
                  1930s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn19" id="page-driggers-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  Later in the Brooklyn years, Pleasants would also make his
                  most significant purchase, acquiring in 1950 a monumental
                  stone sculpture from Veracruz from gallerist Pierre Matisse
                  (1900–1989), who had been one of Pleasants’s contacts during
                  his years at the Peabody (fig. 4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn20" id="page-driggers-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Similar in style to the Lápida de Tepatlaxco, itself created
                  in the first millennium CE in an area near Orizaba, Veracruz,
                  the sculpture sourced from Matisse has now been identified as
                  among the first works to be sold by artist Diego Rivera
                  (1886–1957) on the international art market.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn21" id="page-driggers-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Matisse may also have been the source for another Pleasants
                  work, a stone <em>palma</em> from Veracruz that was previously
                  owned by governor of Veracruz Teodoro Dehesa Méndez
                  (1848–1936; fig. 5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn22" id="page-driggers-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  Today, we know that Dehesa’s relative had entrusted a number
                  of sculptures to Matisse for sale, suggesting that he could
                  have been the source for the Pleasants palma as well.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn23" id="page-driggers-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  This collection of details about specific acquisitions surely
                  underlies a broader picture of Pleasants as a collector,
                  although that picture remains to be further clarified.

                  While Pleasants’s collecting patterns are only beginning to
                  emerge, what is better documented is the sensational impact of
                  the collection once its owner moved to Tucson in 1958. Soon
                  thereafter, the Arizona State Museum mounted a 1962 exhibition
                  of his holdings. The show was accompanied by a published
                  catalog with listings of many of the definitive works from his
                  collection, suggesting that by that year, most of the major
                  acquisitions had already been made.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn24" id="page-driggers-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  In the wake of the exhibition, Pleasants began transferring
                  his collection to museums, and the Arizona State Museum
                  received several important objects, including important Andean
                  weavings. However, Pleasants evidently determined within a few
                  years that many gifts from his collection should be routed
                  toward an art-focused institution instead.

                  In 1965, Pleasants transferred the Veracruz sculpture that he
                  purchased from Matisse to the Tucson Art Center, where he had
                  taken a position on the board. This donation was a remarkable
                  vote of confidence for an organization that at that point had
                  a collection of fewer than forty artworks, almost all of which
                  were works on paper. Even so, Pleasants envisioned that the
                  center might become a serious place for the study of
                  regionally significant art from periods before Arizona
                  statehood. In his words, he saw “a great opportunity to
                  develop a distinguished collection of both pre-Columbian and
                  Latin American Colonial art and to have both permanent and
                  temporary exhibitions of the finest examples of those arts
                  characteristic of Tucson and the Southwest.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn25" id="page-driggers-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Loans of additional objects, and then additional gifts,
                  followed: In 1972, Pleasants donated jades that had just been
                  published by the Emmerich Gallery (fig. 6), a Chocholá-style
                  vessel, and a Wari tapestry-woven tunic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn26" id="page-driggers-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  Pleasants also donated the foundations of a research library,
                  giving the young institution over two thousand scholarly
                  volumes and thousands of slides.

                  To exhibit the Veracuz sculpture and other Pleasants objects,
                  the Tucson Art Center quickly established a Primitive Art Room
                  in its rented quarters at the historic Kingan House in
                  downtown. Pleasants’s pieces were joined there by other loaned
                  works from Tucson collectors, including dealer Rollings and
                  Costa Rican art collector Frank Appleton. Because the gallery
                  was small, Pleasants planned a quickly rotating exhibition to
                  display a sequence of selected objects. For a few weeks, the
                  gallery highlighted works from what he called “nuclear
                  America,” which were then replaced by Costa Rican antiquities,
                  followed thereafter by Andean textiles, and so on.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn27" id="page-driggers-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  These years saw the Art Center’s director, E. F. Sanguinetti
                  (1917–2002), photographed in the
                  <em>Tucson Daily Citizen</em>, posed in a near-embrace of the
                  Veracruz sculpture to which he looked, in the words of the
                  reporter, with “obvious pleasure.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn28" id="page-driggers-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  As the institution’s collecting and exhibitions of ancient
                  American art built momentum, subsequent directors expressed
                  their elation at the prospect of making Tucson a center for
                  ancient American art. One interim director, Gerrit C. Cone,
                  remarked that the donation had inspired “a new faith in the
                  Art Center, its program and its staff.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn29" id="page-driggers-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In those years, the Art Center’s leadership was clear about
                  its commitment to forming what was envisioned as a
                  “distinctive regional museum featuring the legacy of
                  pre-Columbian and other primitive art, Spanish Colonial,
                  Western, and folk art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn30" id="page-driggers-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Rather than form an encyclopedic collection—an
                  impossibility—the museum chose to foreground local relevance,
                  focusing on areas important to the history of southern
                  Arizona. Such a regional focus would still allow for
                  international reach and collaboration. One hope was that when
                  the museum managed to secure a permanent building, it might
                  include a “Mexican Room,” a gallery for showing exhibitions
                  organized by Mexican museums.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn31" id="page-driggers-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  Little more than a decade later, the museum’s board would back
                  away from its regionalist focus.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn32" id="page-driggers-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  But in the late 1960s and early 1970s, ancient American and
                  colonial Latin American art centered their vision for the
                  future. Though it did not yet have a building, the institution
                  had an identity: It would define itself by its commitments to
                  Mexico and the Americas, conserving histories that made Tucson
                  distinctive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Enthusiasm for the Art Center’s mission and its formalization
                  as a museum was helped along by observers from the outside.
                  Dudley Tate Easby Jr. (1905–1973) and Elizabeth Kennedy Easby
                  (1925–1992), then at work organizing The Metropolitan Museum’s
                  monumental <em>Before Cortés</em> exhibition, came to Tucson
                  in 1969 and spoke approvingly of the institution’s intention
                  to focus on the ancient Americas. In Dudley Easby’s flattering
                  comments to Tucson press, by prioritizing this area, “the
                  center here would be doing what the Metropolitan Museum should
                  have been doing for the past 97 years.” He did not hesitate to
                  opine, though, on the intractable problem of financing the
                  center’s transition into a professional museum, criticizing
                  city government for failing to “face up to whether or not they
                  want an art center and start planning how to support it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn33" id="page-driggers-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>

                  A few years later, the Veracruz monument was photographed in
                  the news once again, this time as it was uncrated following
                  its return from <em>Before Cortés</em> (fig. 7). The loan was
                  heralded as a triumph: A piece from Tucson’s new collection
                  had shown alongside works from major international
                  museums.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn34" id="page-driggers-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  The enduring question, though, was how the Art Center might
                  grow into a more mature institution in its own right and
                  secure a new, fixed home. True to its institutional identity,
                  the museum would look to the ancient American collection as
                  part of the strategy that promoted its growth. That growth,
                  however, meant intervening in a downtown environment where
                  Tucson’s identity as a Borderlands place was being
                  renegotiated.

                <h2>Urban Renewal and Tucson’s Ancient American Collection</h2>
                <p>
                  The years when the Tucson Art Center’s attention turned
                  decisively to ancient American art were also pivotal years in
                  the story of downtown’s changing identity. Until the
                  mid-1960s, Mexican American and Mexican communities made
                  downtown Tucson a busy urban center, alongside Indigenous and
                  Chinese immigrant communities. In the district that residents
                  called la calle—located around one of Tucson’s main
                  thoroughfares of the time, Meyer Avenue—Mexican American
                  Tucsonans ran businesses in mixed-use structures, some of
                  which were built during the city’s Mexican period in the first
                  half of the nineteenth century. Community spaces offered
                  places to gather. La Placita, the community’s public square,
                  hosted celebrations for patron San Agustín, and the nearby
                  Plaza Theater screened Spanish-language films produced across
                  Latin America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn35" id="page-driggers-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1964, however, the city of Tucson began working on an urban
                  renewal plan that would displace most of the residents of la
                  calle. In a meticulous study of the fate of the district,
                  historian Lydia Otero noted both the process and rhetoric of
                  this project. A decades-long effort had labeled the homes and
                  businesses of downtown’s Mexican Americans as “slums,”
                  preparing the way for their condemnation and removal. Cultural
                  institutions were implicated in this plan; period documents
                  suggest that the plan was that once the existing district was
                  cleared, Tucson could rebuild with a “good cultural base,” in
                  the words of the Commission on Municipal Blight.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn36" id="page-driggers-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A number of influential voices opposed this plan. Otero has
                  shown, for example, that the publisher of the
                  <em>Arizona Daily Star</em> urged caution, writing: “Must the
                  people of Tucson destroy this remaining area of former Mexican
                  life just because the streets are too narrow and buildings
                  old? . . . Maybe someday Tucsonans would look back at urban
                  renewal and wonder why they authorized such a project which
                  wiped out at one stroke what remained of Mexico in
                  Tucson.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn37" id="page-driggers-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  These concerns notwithstanding, voters approved the plan, and
                  la calle fell to urban renewal. The essential votes passed in
                  1966, just months after the Art Center acquired its Veracruz
                  sculpture.

                  The private Art Center’s need for a new space to meet its
                  ambitions intersected with the city’s interest in building up
                  a “cultural base” downtown, and director Sanguinetti began
                  expressing his wish to benefit from the project to the press
                  in 1965. If given a square block within the urban renewal
                  footprint, he noted, the museum could “enrich community life
                  and would provide a historical, psychological, and cultural
                  focus around which the whole city might pulse.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn38" id="page-driggers-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  Ultimately, for a rent of a dollar a year, the museum would be
                  allowed to build within the boundaries of Tucson’s historic
                  Presidio, dating to 1775 when Tucson was part of New Spain, at
                  a site that had once held an ancestral pit house nearly two
                  millennia ago (fig. 8).

                  Sonoran-style structure with architecture that partly predated
                  the Gadsden Purchase, the Cordova House was the living home of
                  a notable family of la calle. Through eminent domain, the city
                  condemned the home, a decision that the Cordovas tried for
                  years to reverse in court.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn39" id="page-driggers-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>

                  The Tucson Art Center was thus set on a path to build a home
                  for its new collections at a place central to the Mexican
                  identity of the city. Seeking funds to advance the project,
                  ancient American artworks became the visual icons of the
                  building fund, aligning the construction that would take place
                  near the Cordova House with the image of a future home for the
                  “pre-Columbian.” Pleasants’s Veracruz sculpture was the image
                  selected for the poster soliciting financial support (fig.
                  10), and a drawing of the palma appeared on the sign that
                  stood in front of the Building Fund’s downtown offices. The
                  campaign’s iconography underscores that highlighting the
                  museum’s ancient American collection was seen as the way to
                  secure its future within the urban renewal footprint.

                  The new museum opened at last in 1975, and with it came a name
                  change to the Tucson Museum of Art (TMA). Galleries featured
                  artworks from Mexico, including works from the ancient
                  Americas, and next door, the Junior League funded restoration
                  to the Cordova House, converting it from a contemporary
                  Mexican American home and commercial space to a period room of
                  nineteenth-century Mexican Tucson, effectively erasing the
                  experience of the home’s most recent residents.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn40" id="page-driggers-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Urban renewal’s effects on Mexican American communities in
                  Tucson were deeply felt, and the memory of this displacement
                  is still articulated by community members today. Otero
                  documents a sentiment often expressed in the city: Downtown
                  left behind its Mexican American community, choosing to invest
                  instead in an idea of an economically vigorous center that in
                  reality failed to compete with the city’s suburban
                  expansion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn41" id="page-driggers-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  No single narrative neatly encapsulates the museum’s role in
                  downtown’s changing identity. While the museum’s galleries and
                  collecting looked to preserve material histories of Tucson’s
                  relationship to Mexican identities and the ancient American
                  past, that narrative was presentable only because the museum
                  had benefitted from the urban renewal project. Conserving
                  historical and ancient Latin American arts was, and remains, a
                  meaningful project for communities of the Southwest, but the
                  environment in which the spaces for the permanent collection
                  were born broadly displaced Mexican American communities from
                  participation in many aspects of downtown’s vitality. These
                  conditions make showing ancient American art in the
                  Borderlands distinctive: The collection resonates with the
                  identity formation of local communities, but its presentation
                  could only be possible through intervention into a landscape
                  of layered histories and conflicting interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The museum early on sincerely embraced and played a role in
                  fostering local Mexican American traditions, taking on
                  projects that gave it a role in preserving the heritage of la
                  calle alongside ancient American and colonial Latin American
                  artworks. From its early years, it imagined itself as a place
                  for Mexican Americans to gather. Every year beginning in the
                  1970s, Tucsonan María Luisa Tena and members of prominent
                  Mexican American Tucsonense families organized a nativity
                  scene, <em>El Nacimiento</em>, in the Cordova House, welcomed
                  with a community procession. Tucson mounted exhibitions in its
                  first decades of works by contemporary Chicano artists, and in
                  1992, it hosted the landmark exhibition
                  <em>Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation</em> (CARA). These
                  kinds of activities became part of a new image of cultural
                  identity in Tucson, in which the ancient American collection
                  played a part, though spatial tensions endured.

                  Over time, the museum’s relationship to its ancient American
                  collections changed. By 1983, it appears that some board
                  members had already begun to feel that the museum’s vision of
                  a “distinctive regionalism” might have been too restrictive.
                  An attempt to formalize the collecting policy to limit the
                  museum to what it called pre-Columbian, Spanish colonial, and
                  western art evidently met with displeasure, as an appetite was
                  growing for the museum to embrace contemporary art. Director
                  Andrew Maass was compelled to negotiate the identity of the
                  museum in the press. He said, “I think we are a regional
                  museum with a responsibility to present its collections and
                  its exhibitions with a regional focus. . . . Here’s a
                  regionalism for the West. I don’t think it’s anything to be
                  scared of.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn42" id="page-driggers-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  A new gallery for the ancient American collections was
                  installed that year to great acclaim, expanding to a roomy new
                  presentation in the finally finished building (fig. 11).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn43" id="page-driggers-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2001, the museum installed a new presentation of ancient
                  American art, positioning the field within a new conceptual
                  frame, along with a historical architectural one. Artworks
                  from Latin America, ancient to contemporary, were newly
                  brought together and reinstalled in another of the Presidio’s
                  historic houses, an adobe structure built in 1865. Reconceived
                  by Joanne Stuhr, Americas curator from 1993 to 2003, the Latin
                  American galleries emphasized Mesoamerican heritage as part of
                  the Arizona-Mexico regional identity. The following year,
                  Stuhr led TMA in originating an exhibition of Casas Grandes
                  ceramics,
                  <em>Talking Birds, Plumed Serpents and Painted Women</em>. The
                  exhibition was a collaboration with INAH archaeologists and
                  the Amerind Foundation that again emphasized the regional
                  relevance of ancient Mesoamerican traditions. Latin American
                  art projects were advanced in the following years by curators
                  Stephen Vollmer (2004–06), Fatima Bercht (2007–09), and Anna
                  Seiferle-Valencia (2010–12).

                  The end of the 2010s brought new approaches to the ancient
                  American collection, as well as a reckoning with the history
                  of the Cordova House. New galleries were planned for TMA’s
                  ancient American collections, the first expansion of the
                  museum’s physical footprint since 1983. Around the same time,
                  the Cordova House was newly reinterpreted—this time, with the
                  collaboration and cooperation of descendants of the Mexican
                  American community affected by the urban renewal and with
                  didactic panels explaining how urban renewal changed downtown
                  Tucson. For the first time since its displacement, María
                  Navarrete Cordova’s portrait returned to the Cordova House,
                  reinserting the family and the memory of la calle into its
                  narrative (fig. 12).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-driggers-fn44" id="page-driggers-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>

                <p>
                  From 2019 to 2024, I was responsible for TMA’s Latin American
                  collections. The museum’s commitment to art from the region
                  grew in those years with the construction and opening of the
                  Kasser Family Wing of Latin American Art in 2020, a project
                  that expanded galleries for the collection and focused
                  exhibitions. Ancient American collections were foregrounded in
                  the project, now expanded with gifts from I. Michael and Beth
                  Kasser and Paul L. and Alice C. Baker. At the project’s
                  outset, the museum’s approach to objects of heritage had
                  already begun to evolve in light of the experience of
                  reinterpreting the Cordova House and recontextualizing the
                  Indigenous North American arts collections. Curating new
                  ancient American galleries meant developing a project that
                  created community participation, collaboration, and a
                  polyvocal approach. Texts authored by community members with
                  heritage relationships to the ancient Americas appear
                  alongside exhibited objects, and curatorial interpretations
                  have sought to amplify connections between works and the
                  specific histories of Latinx communities in Tucson.

                  This approach has also characterized temporary exhibitions of
                  ancient American art pursued in recent years. To take one
                  example, the city became home to many Guatemalan refugees in
                  the 1980s, and a 2023 exhibition
                  <em>Popol Vuh and the Maya Art of Storytelling</em> presented
                  ancient objects in light of the words of community members,
                  who shared ideas about the relationship of narrative arts to
                  heritage, alongside commissioned art by contemporary artist
                  Justin Favela (fig. 13). A large-scale feature exhibition of
                  Andean cloth,
                  <em>CUMBI: Textiles, Society, and Memory in Andean South
                    America</em>
                  (2023–24) looked at weavings across time (including many
                  donated by Pleasants) and displayed the work of contemporary
                  textile artists of Andean heritage who practiced in or had
                  ties to the Southwest. Today, the museum works to fulfill a
                  vision of connecting ancient American art with Tucson’s
                  community that was intended at the collection’s founding but
                  with a new commitment to inclusion that charts the way
                  forward.

                        In using the term “Borderlands” to describe the context
                        of Tucson’s cultural politics, I invoke the work of
                        theorist and poet Gloria Anzaldúa, with particular
                        reference to her reflections on existence in this region
                        in
                        <em>Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza</em> (Aunt
                        Lute, 1987). Anzaldúa’s work addresses the identity of
                        subjects in relation to the geographic boundaries of
                        national borders, as well as the shifting and emerging
                        psychological and creative space of the region as
                        informed by its intersecting, multiple histories.

                  During the symposium, works sourced from the Stendahl Art
                  Galleries were referred to in almost every presentation, from
                  museum collections in New York to Denver. Particularly before
                  1970, no other single art gallery or art dealer had such
                  impact in the formulation of museum collections in the area of
                  prehispanic art. At the symposium, scholars evaluated
                  individual institutional histories in the United States,
                  especially those of art museums, with respect to the civic
                  responsibilities shouldered by institutions and the
                  opportunities that different curatorial departments undertook,
                  sometimes with the engaged interest of individual collectors,
                  who sought to bring an institution in line with their own
                  passions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But none of these collections could have been formed without
                  the leadership of an extraordinary salesman: Earl Stendahl
                  (1888–1966). Stendahl invented the business of prehispanic
                  art. Before 1940, acquiring prehispanic art was often a more
                  touristic and haphazard entrepreneurial endeavor, with little
                  substantial difference between anthropology and art history.
                  Such blurriness was indeed the case once one stepped anywhere
                  outside of European and American collections of painting and
                  sculpture, including the arts of Africa and Oceania. Stendahl
                  marketed to collectors and to museums, and early on, he saw
                  the market value of securing venues that would drive other
                  sales, whether in the permanent collection of the Seattle Art
                  Museum or in the temporary exhibitions he organized locally in
                  southern California and internationally. And eventually there
                  would be other attendant effects: Acquisitions by museums
                  would become core works in survey texts and classroom
                  instruction.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn1" id="page-miller-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Stendahl could have taught a course in market development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can learn today a great deal about how this market took
                  shape from the letters the family exchanged with one another
                  from the late 1940s until his death in 1966. Stendahl, his
                  son, Alfred (Al; 1915–2010), his wife, Enid (1889–1979), and
                  his son-in-law, Joe Dammann (1922–1971), all participated in
                  the family business and wrote letters to one another,
                  especially when conducting business away from Los Angeles. The
                  Getty Research Institute (GRI) has 357 of these family letters
                  in its holdings in box 105, part of the comprehensive archive
                  of the Stendahl Art Galleries (SAG) business documentation, an
                  archive that comprises stock books, photographs, and extensive
                  correspondence with dealers (e.g., Guillermo Echániz
                  [1900–1965] in Mexico), collectors (e.g., Nelson Rockefeller
                  [1908–1979], founder of the Museum of Primitive Art), and
                  museums (e.g., Dayton Art Institute and its director Thomas
                  Colt [1905–1985]). Held in folders at the end of the archive,
                  and many written on aerograms and other very lightweight
                  paper, these letters have rarely been consulted.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn2" id="page-miller-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  The information in the letters sheds light on family life,
                  competitors, Los Angeles, and much more. Most of all, this
                  archive underpins the work conducted by the Pre-Hispanic Art
                  Provenance Initiative (PHAPI), dedicated to examining and
                  interpreting the business of selling ancient art of Latin
                  America in the United States and elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn3" id="page-miller-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                  Explicit business correspondence was always important to Earl
                  Stendahl and the SAG, and starting in 1940, the gallery grew
                  to become the largest volume seller of prehispanic art in the
                  1960s in the United States. In 2021, the GRI published eight
                  letters between Earl Stendahl and Guillermo Echániz, written
                  over a period of fifteen months, from October 1940 until
                  January 1942.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn4" id="page-miller-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  The shipping lanes to Europe and Asia from the United States
                  had closed at the beginning of the period of this
                  correspondence, and by January 1942, the United States was at
                  war with the Axis powers and mail was under federal scrutiny,
                  if not censorship. The SAG was just finding its way to
                  extensive business in Mexico and was dependent on Echániz.
                  These eight letters show the development of the business,
                  cultivating buyers Ambassador Robert Woods Bliss (1875–1962),
                  who had established the museum and research center Dumbarton
                  Oaks, in Washington, DC, with his wife, Mildred Barnes Bliss
                  (1879–1869), and Walter and Louise Arensberg (1878–1954;
                  1879–1953), who collected modern and pre-Columbian art, as
                  well as the slippery tactics undertaken to remove objects
                  illicitly from Mexican archaeological contexts and move them
                  across the border to the United States. Perhaps because of the
                  nature of the business or perhaps because of the censors,
                  Stendahl and Echániz often wrote in coded references.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The family letters, though, are different—unfiltered and
                  uncoded correspondence written a generation later, when the
                  business was in full swing. But “full swing” did not mean that
                  financial success was certain, even when the Stendahls had
                  developed multiple sources across multiple countries and a
                  worldwide clientele. They established a New York beachhead for
                  the business, and Earl and Enid became well-known at the best
                  hotels in Europe. Mail—and frequently international mail—was
                  the means by which the extended family worked, played,
                  criticized, and supported one another. Although on the surface
                  the family letters are the means of exchanging pleasantries
                  regarding weather, home maintenance, and notes of outcomes
                  from the racetrack, this correspondence is often revealing in
                  the private comments regarding the sales process and the
                  opinions of potential buyers. “I now feel strongly that Jan or
                  February sale is in order. Get what we can out of as much junk
                  as we can sell,” wrote Al to his father, probably in 1957,
                  describing the possibility of some high-volume, low-value
                  sales.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn5" id="page-miller-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  On paper, Earl was tough on his son, Al, and son-in-law, Joe,
                  grousing about their failure to get accounts paid and paid
                  off. At home in Los Angeles, the gallerists could have
                  registered their complaints in person: From the road, the
                  letter was the recourse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As revealing as such comments may be, these letters are even
                  more important in their documentation, no matter how oblique,
                  of business practices. The focus of PHAPI is to reveal and
                  link these practices: While stock books and inventories
                  document the formal side of the practice, the family letters
                  point to the ways that three principals—Earl, Al, and
                  Joe—shared different responsibilities, from navigating works
                  across international borders to paying gardeners at the
                  gallery and expressing ire at unpaid invoices with frank
                  comments about friends and competitors. They also kept an eye
                  out for the opinions of archaeologists and art historians.
                  Because the SAG was the single largest vendor of prehispanic
                  art in its heyday, understanding the practices also helps
                  reveal the picture of the many routes by which such works
                  entered art museums. In many ways, working through the SAG
                  archive is akin to discovering a complete archaeological
                  stratum, one known only through the occasional trade object
                  encountered hither and yon. With these records the big
                  picture, year by year, can start to come into focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike the data of the stock books, the content of the family
                  letters cannot be summarized: Their level of granular detail
                  resists the big picture, yet no big picture can be drawn
                  without them. The family letters show how Earl was always on
                  the hunt for more and better business, with private collectors
                  and museums across the world—and while cryptic, the letters
                  also show that Earl kept an enormous number of details in his
                  head, juggling purchases in Mexico with sales and purchases in
                  Europe. Failed business deals, rarely noted in the stock
                  books, are a regular feature of the family letters. In these
                  accounts, Earl kept an eye on his two younger partners (who
                  were more typically in Los Angeles) and the competition
                  emerging both nearby and in New York. He kept his “frenemies”
                  close: cajoling and collaborating with them. He expressed
                  bitterness at those sellers abroad, particularly in Mexico,
                  who gave a better deal or first choice to his US competition.
                  And he sought new avenues of promotion—from local exhibitions
                  to what became a Stendahl grand tour of European institutions
                  from 1958 to 1963. For a man who had once been poor, who would
                  turn time and again to his background as a candymaker when
                  times were tough, he had arrived both at home in Los Angeles
                  and beyond.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn6" id="page-miller-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  By the time of his death in 1966, Earl penned letters home on
                  stationery from glamorous hotels in New York and abroad.
                </p>

                  The rest of this essay includes portions of family letters. My
                  glosses and their specific focus point to a larger picture of
                  the SAG practice. The family letters are most dense and
                  interlocking from 1954 until just before Earl’s death in 1966,
                  and so small selections of these letters will be drawn from
                  those years, ending with a letter from December 1965 that
                  reveals a deal the SAG failed to make. Dozens of letters
                  document the five years between 1958 and 1963; addressed
                  briefly elsewhere, those letters focus on developing new
                  markets and new inventory, often of classical antiquities,
                  with much of the business conducted in Europe.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn7" id="page-miller-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  To keep this essay focused on the prehispanic market in the
                  United States, the letters selected here date from 1954 to
                  1956 and from 1963 until 1965. Letters from Earl, Al, Joe, and
                  Enid all point to different aspects of the business, and each
                  has a very specific voice, from brusque to chatty, and when
                  speaking of the young children in the family, even tender.
                  Spelling and punctuation rarely meet the standards of the day
                  and are retained here. Dates have been reconstructed, by and
                  large, by the PHAPI project. Full transcriptions of the
                  letters can be found in the Appendix of this volume. The
                  selections that follow have been taken from larger contexts,
                  as seen in the illustration of the original letter in the GRI
                  archives.

                  Threaded through the family letters are sales of works by
                  European artists. Here, Al apparently shipped a Picasso out of
                  the Los Angeles International Airport. Did he build the crate
                  for the artwork? The letter is vague on that point.

                  Robert (Bob) Stolper (1920–2013) worked closely and
                  competitively with the SAG from 1950 until 1970 or so. He sold
                  prehispanic and other works of art in Los Angeles, New York,
                  and London and is the nonfamily member most widely referred to
                  in the family letters. He kept an apartment in Mexico City in
                  the 1960s, perhaps principally for making purchases. He seems
                  to have also kept an apartment at 11 East 68th Street in New
                  York (The Marquand, built in 1913), perhaps adjacent to the
                  Stendahls’ place in the same building. This letter was
                  presumably written in Los Angeles. What seems to have happened
                  is that Julius Carlebach (1909–1964) had called Stolper by
                  telephone from his home and gallery in New York, and Stolper
                  then dropped by the SAG. Al was eager to get it all down on
                  paper to his father. Carlebach sold a diverse “primitive”
                  inventory and purchased extensively from the SAG, as evidenced
                  in the stock books. Given the date of 1954, Carlebach (whose
                  gallery was at 943/937 Third Avenue) would have known the 1952
                  exhibition <em>Ancient Tarascan Art</em> at the Sidney Janis
                  Gallery, which consisted of loans or works on commission from
                  SAG. There is no known surviving archive of Carlebach today,
                  but he was one of the principal dealers to sell to Fred Olsen
                  (1891–1996), whose prehispanic collection is now at the Yale
                  University Art Gallery.

                  And who was Frederick Peterson (1920–2009), addressed next in
                  this letter? The author of <em>Ancient Mexico</em> (1959),
                  Peterson was a long-standing faculty member at the University
                  of West Virginia, who had documented thousands of prehispanic
                  objects in both public and private collections in the 1950s;
                  one copy of his documentation survives today at the University
                  of New Mexico.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn8" id="page-miller-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  He was well connected in both Mexico and the United States,
                  and fake Maya codices, as discussed in this letter, circulated
                  both in 1954 and today.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn9" id="page-miller-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  In what might seem to be a non sequitur, the letter connects
                  the codices to Jaina Island (an unlikely origin, all in all),
                  and April Dammann has recounted how Earl secured permission to
                  film on Jaina Island in 1952.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn10" id="page-miller-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  He and his crew then proceeded to loot the island for a month,
                  filling oversized cases with dozens, if not hundreds of
                  figurines—so he was “damned lucky” with his timing, as Al
                  noted in the letter, especially as interest in Maya art ramped
                  up: Robert Woods Bliss and Nelson Rockefeller had both made
                  significant acquisitions of Maya objects by then. “Campeche”
                  is probably a shorthand reference to one of the Stendahl’s
                  Mexican partners operating in Yucatan, probably Alberto
                  Márquez or less likely José Maria Palomeque, to stay ahead of
                  other buyers, particularly Jorge Hauswaldt, a German émigré in
                  Mexico, and Echániz, Earl’s principal Mexican partner.

                  Several advisers and authenticators played key roles with
                  respect to the quality and integrity of the Stendahl
                  inventory. One of the most important individuals to dealers
                  and collectors in New York was Gordon Ekholm (1909–1987),
                  Mesoamerican curator at the American Museum of Natural History
                  (AMNH), who also advised Ernst Erickson (1893–1983) on
                  building the collection Erickson would donate to the AMNH.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn11" id="page-miller-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Presumably written in New York, this six-page letter, written
                  over multiple days, noted that Robert and Mildred Bliss came
                  to examine works in a bank vault with Ekholm and perhaps a
                  “young Mexican,” although it is hard to follow the timing. The
                  “young Mexican” might be Jose Luis Franco, the Mexican
                  authenticator with whom Ekholm was friendly and who may have
                  been involved in the export of antiquities at some point.
                  Although dated 1954, at this point, Bliss was already planning
                  the book that would be published in 1957,
                  <em>Pre-Columbian Art: Robert Woods Bliss Collection</em>,
                  written by Samuel K. Lothrop, Joy Mahler, and William Foshag,
                  a spectacular coffee table book featuring the Bliss
                  collection. Earl has this book in mind as he begins to plan
                  the publication
                  <em>Pre-Columbian Art of Mexico and Central America</em>,
                  published posthumously by Harry N. Abrams (1968).

                    had a drink and wanted me to buy the necklace for $2400.00.
                    I did not. Had a chance to get plain to New Orleans so got
                    there about 7:30 P.M. Called Bliss to see if he would be
                    home on Thursday. Was so got into Washington about 6 A.M.
                    Went to bed left a call for 8:30 and was out to see Bliss

                  Earl continued to pursue Maya art, using a short layover in
                  Merida, Mexico, to meet with Alberto Marquez, a source for him
                  there (Earl declined to purchase a necklace), en route to New
                  Orleans and up to Washington, DC, to see Robert Woods Bliss,
                  perhaps his most significant client. The Degas painting at
                  Dumbarton Oaks today (<a href="#page-https-museum-doaks-org-objects-1-info-query-portfolios-20-3d-20-224034-22-20and-20disp-maker-1-20-3d-20-22edgar-20degas-22-and-sort-0" target="_blank">HC.P.1918.02.(O)</a>) was not acquired from Stendahl, so this sale evidently did
                  not take place. The items that Earl showed to Bliss were
                  things he had presumably brought from Mexico City in his
                  luggage, acquired from someone whose name cannot be easily
                  deciphered. He quickly made $1,200 on the deal, selling Bliss
                  the carved mirror (also not a work at Dumbarton Oaks today),
                  and although he told Bliss he would consult Al on a price
                  reduction, he simply informed Al that the price on a “marble”
                  <em>hacha</em> (presumably
                  <a href="#page-http-museum-doaks-org-objects-1-info-22925" target="_blank">PC.B.038</a>) would drop by $3,000.

                    Dr. Kaiser and his wife were down last week from Berkeley.
                    Came in at 3 in the afternoon Sat and did not leave until 3

                    will continue on to Berkeley to deliver the things. Also to

                  Written four days before the assassination of President John
                  F. Kennedy, this letter elucidates how Earl’s son-in-law, Joe
                  Dammann, is thinking about the SAG’s new inventory and new
                  competition. Regardless of the context, the SAG picked up
                  useful intelligence from their clients. Noted in this letter
                  is George Clayton Kennedy (1919–1980), who bought from the SAG
                  but also from other dealers, especially in New York, including
                  Frances Pratt (1913–2003), a dealer at 31–33 West 12th Street
                  in Greenwich Village.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn12" id="page-miller-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  But the big news was about Aaron Furman (1900–1975), who
                  probably sold more African and contemporary art than
                  prehispanic art in his gallery at 46 East 80th Street: In this
                  letter, he had a Maya stela from Guatemala for sale for
                  $60,000. An increasing number of dealers were working from New
                  York in the 1960s and focusing on Maya and Olmec inventory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The key new client here is Dr. William F. Kaiser of Berkeley,
                  who spent $12,500 in twelve hours. One can only imagine the
                  party that ended at 3 a.m. Joe described how he would seal the
                  deal by delivering the acquisitions to Dr. Kaiser in person in
                  a few days. He also had plans to visit other new clients.
                  Works from the collection of Dr. and Mrs. Kaiser are
                  periodically sold at auction; a notable Zapotec urn from the
                  collection was drawn by Adam Sellen.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn13" id="page-miller-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Joe also describes a plan to sell the Mosaic Jaguar, a work
                  eventually published in <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> on
                  February 8, 1964, to accompany the article “Art from Nobody
                  Knows Where” that detailed the rampant looting in Mexico that
                  was feeding prominent collections in the US despite Mexican
                  laws prohibiting it. The Mosaic Jaguar was actually a blatant
                  forgery, and its location is not known today.

                    Dear Enid– Somebody cut off our telephone B4 I had finished
                    so I am writting the news as of the passed week. Ernest just
                    left after a lovely steak dinner and I have just finished
                    the dishes.

                    I deposited the check from Tomayo 400.00 also the 500.00
                    check from the woman in Cleveland of the Sasanian ring. Also
                    a check from Heeramanic of 500.00 for the little Islamic
                    bracelett wich was stolen from us.

                    Was walking home with Ernest one evening and he meet a
                    friend of his a Mr Dr Arthur Sackler. We took him up to the
                    appartment and he had a very exciting evening looking at our
                    treasures. He liked the larg Amlash bull. The next day he
                    had Frank Caro come in to pass on it. Caro and his son were
                    as much excited as he was. Today Dr Sackler came in and
                    bought it for 12000.00. . . . He also reserved the small
                    gold cup from Persia for $6000.00. He woud rather have the
                    larger cup for 15000.00 but this is the one Rothchild of
                    Paris reserved. . . .

                    Evidently the Dr Sackler will put up the money for these as
                    he give the Museum of American Indian money for purchases-so

                  A year later, things were on the up and up; Lyndon B. Johnson
                  had been elected president in his own right, and the economy
                  was booming. Earl wrote to Enid from New York, in the
                  apartment the SAG leased at 11 East 68th Street. He had just
                  had dinner, apparently in his own apartment, with Ernest
                  Erickson, the single greatest patron of prehispanic art in
                  this period at AMNH.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn14" id="page-miller-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  The woman in Cleveland may be Mrs. Emery Norweb, a trustee at
                  the Cleveland Museum of Art (see Bergh, this volume). This
                  letter is further evidence of the SAG relationship with the
                  Heeramanecks, major dealers in Los Angeles and New York,
                  particularly of South and Southeast Asian art. Today the
                  Heeramaneck collection of prehispanic art is in the National
                  Museum, New Delhi, India, the sole such collection in that
                  nation.

                  The story that Earl went on to relate to his wife is downright
                  picaresque, a litany of key New York players in the art world:
                  Erickson introduced Earl to Dr. Arthur Sackler (1913–1987),
                  and they had a fine time examining works in the Stendahl
                  apartment, particularly an Amlash Bull. Sackler subsequently
                  brought his own art consultant, Frank Caro, a Chinese
                  specialist, to advise him. What follows points to, without
                  fully explaining, fuzzy documentation at the National Museum
                  of the American Indian (NMAI).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn15" id="page-miller-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Frederick Dockstader (1919–1998), director of the Museum of
                  the American Indian, came to see Stendahl, ordered up $10,000
                  worth of objects, and Dr. Sackler was said to be footing the
                  bill. Earl considered himself lucky, especially in the gifts
                  that his clients also sent him, suggesting the exchange
                  economy between gallerist and collectors: Mrs. (Daniel) Michel
                  of Chicago sent him a dozen roses, and Jan Mitchell sent him
                  two cases of whiskey.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn16" id="page-miller-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>

                  Mitchell then threw a dinner party at Lüchow’s, his famous New
                  York establishment near Union Square, with the Easbys and
                  Ekholms in attendance, as well as Jane Powell (and husband) of
                  the Brooklyn Museum, Julie Jones, curator of pre-Columbian art
                  at the Museum of Primitive Art, and Ernest Erickson. Dudley
                  and Elizabeth Easby (1905–1973; 1925–1992) were important
                  figures in New York; Dudley was a Metropolitan Museum trustee,
                  and Elizabeth would be one of the curators of
                  <em>Before Cortes: Sculpture of Middle America</em> (1971), a
                  signature exhibition of prehispanic art in New York. Jane
                  Powell (1930–1993) left the Brooklyn Museum after a short
                  stint there and is better known as Jane Dwyer from her days as
                  director of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown
                  University. Julie Jones (1935–2021) would go on to become the
                  head of the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the
                  Americas at The Met for twenty-one years and curator emeritus
                  until her death in 2021.

                  The letter concludes with Earl’s travel schedule for the next
                  ten days or so in Europe and a request to Enid to ship Los
                  Angeles inventory on to New York.

                  A few months after his letter to Enid, in early 1965, Earl
                  took a trip to Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, and then
                  returned to New York. Business was booming, and the SAG was
                  selling all sorts of antiquities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Minneapolis, Earl met with Samuel Sachs II (b. 1935), the
                  deputy director, later to be director, at the Detroit
                  Institute of Art (and then briefly at the Frick Collection),
                  and was able to propose numerous sales. In Chicago, he visited
                  more clientele: Raymond Wielgus (1920–2010), whose collection
                  is now in the Eskenazi Museum at Indiana University, and the
                  Art Institute of Chicago, where Alan Wardwell (1935–1999) was
                  the first Curator of Primitive Art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn17" id="page-miller-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  In Detroit, Earl worked with curator Francis Robinson, selling
                  Amlash works that the SAG purchased during the European tour.
                  But the expensive object on offer in 1965 was a “Maya stone,”
                  optioned for $35,000, then reduced to $28,000, which Earl
                  indicated would be offered to Minnesota if Detroit took a
                  pass. Detroit did pass; it is possible that the monument Earl
                  referred to is
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-artsmia-org-art-8545-stela-fragment-maya" target="_blank">Stela 2 from Piedras Negras</a>, now at the Minneapolis Museum of Art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn18" id="page-miller-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Back in New York, Jan Mitchell was considered “hot” by the
                  SAG, which is to say “ready to spend money.” A paragraph
                  below, Mr. and Mrs. Noah Torno of Toronto are also “hot,” and
                  elsewhere in the letters and invoices, they are serious
                  shoppers. The Cohens, Dr. Sackler, “Cleveland,” Jay Leff—Earl
                  stayed on top of potential buyers, and by spelling them out in
                  this letter, he reminded Al and Joe to do the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was news for Earl to share as well: Another client Nasli
                  Heeramaneck (1902–1971) had had a stroke. And then Earl
                  waffled on shipping an object to a potential buyer, given its
                  condition and worried that, if the client actually saw the
                  work, the sale would fall through.

                <p>
                  From time to time, Enid’s letters—generally fewer in
                  number—make astonishing revelations. In a letter written in
                  December 1965, Enid recounted how Earl failed to close a deal
                  with William Spratling (1900–1967).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Matthew Robb and I have discussed elsewhere, this is the
                  first known notice of Chalcatzingo Monument 9 in New York and
                  the earliest specific attribution to William Spratling as the
                  agent of its removal from Mexico to the United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn19" id="page-miller-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  No other member of the Stendahl family made note of the
                  aborted transaction with Spratling. Enid indicated that René
                  d’Harnoncourt (1901–1968), director of the Museum of Modern
                  Art and often consulted by Nelson Rockefeller, who founded the
                  Museum of Primitive Art in 1957, turned it down with a “curt,
                  negative, No.” From this letter it is difficult to determine
                  whether $4,000 was the full price or half of the price;
                  eventually gallerist André Emmerich (1924–2007) would sell the
                  monument to the Munson-Williams-Proctor Museum of Art in
                  Utica, New York, for $20,000. From other correspondence that
                  Robb and I have consulted, it is clear there was some doubt
                  about the work’s authenticity, and perhaps that is the source
                  of the dig at the end of the letter, making fun of curator
                  Elizabeth Easby, Robert Goldwater, director of the Museum of
                  Primitive Art, and Gordon Ekholm, whose opinion the SAG was so
                  often soliciting. Today Chalcatzingo 9 is back in the state of
                  Morelos, having been repatriated to Mexico.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  In this selection from the family letters, we see the arc of
                  about a decade at the SAG. The SAG took an apartment in New
                  York at the beginning of this period, so they were on the
                  scene as prehispanic business developed there with Frances
                  Pratt, Aaron Furman, and André Emmerich, noted in this
                  selection of letters, and also when Eleanor Ward, Alphonse
                  Jax, and Ed Merrin entered the trade. The Stendahls
                  successfully conducted business with art museums nationwide,
                  from Cleveland and Detroit to St. Louis, as well as sustaining
                  relationships with private collectors, many of whom were
                  building collections that would be foundational for museums.
                  Robert Woods Bliss is the best-known of these collectors and
                  Raymond and Laura Wielgus played an important role at the
                  University of Indiana. By the time of Earl’s death,
                  prehispanic art had permeated most US museums with
                  encyclopedic aspirations, and encyclopedic aspirations were
                  the rule of the 1960s and 1970s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn20" id="page-miller-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The SAG successfully created a business with inventory that
                  could be acquired for a few dollars or several thousand
                  dollars. They launched exhibitions across the United States,
                  particularly in southern California and often at colleges, but
                  also at the Texas State Fair, and extensive catalogs document
                  SAG offerings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-miller-fn21" id="page-miller-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  They learned from collectors, museums, and other dealers,
                  constantly adjusting to capture new business. In the letters
                  cited here, Earl was very interested in Bliss’s plan to
                  publish a lavish coffee table book of his collection, noting
                  the handsome photographs and a $200,000 price tag and the
                  uncertainty of pulling it off. This 1957 book inspired Earl to
                  make plans with the publisher Harry N. Abrams for his own
                  monumental book project, the 1968
                  <em>Pre-Columbian Art of Mexico and Central America</em>, a
                  compendium of works sold by SAG over nearly thirty years,
                  establishing new areas of study and organizational principles
                  for the field. Earl died in 1966, before he could see the
                  project come to fruition, but the plans were well under way.
                  His son, Al, wrote the introduction and curator Hasso Von
                  Winning wrote the text, an opportunity he might not have had
                  without Earl’s death. This book quickly became an
                  indispensable reference, and the publication catapulted Von
                  Winning from a little-known researcher in Los Angeles into a
                  national figure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Stendahls, too, became national and international figures.
                  At the beginning of the decade addressed in this suite of
                  letters, they had a substantial number of regional clients,
                  especially from the motion picture industry, as well as key
                  national collectors such as Bliss and Rockefeller, but during
                  this decade they expanded their clientele dramatically,
                  building greater resilience into their business model. But
                  letters from 1963 onward address a new side of the business,
                  in which monumental works of stone were being stolen from
                  Mexico and Guatemala. Sales of works such as Piedras Negras
                  Stela 2 or Chalcatzingo Monument 9—and the attendant high
                  prices and their visibility—would attract international
                  attention of archaeologists and national governments alike.
                  The Stendahl Art Galleries would not see the picture emerging
                  for many years, but the 1970 United Nations Educational,
                  Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s&nbsp;<a href="#page-https-www-unesco-org-en-legal-affairs-convention-means-prohibiting-and-preventing-illicit-import-export-and-transfer-ownership-cultural" target="_blank">Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the
                    Illicit Export, Import and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural
                    Property</a>
                  as well as the 1972 bilateral agreement between Mexico and the
                  United States would mark the beginning of the end for the SAG.
                  The family letters were filed away, carefully preserved
                  historical documents that today yield exquisite details of a
                  unique Los Angeles business.

                    letters extensively for our article, “Stendahl Art Galleries

                        Pál Kelemen’s 1943
                        <em>Medieval American Art</em> featured many works from
                        the Brummer Gallery, and several of these objects would
                        pass through Stendahl Art Galleries (SAG). Both Michael
                        Coe’s 1966 books, <em>Mexico</em> and <em>The Maya</em>,
                        included SAG objects, as did George Kubler’s 1962 and
                        1975 editions of
                        <em>The Art and Architecture of Ancient America: The
                          Mexican, Maya, and Andean Peoples</em>. Not only did I follow these pioneers in my own work,
                        but many of the designations, from “Nayarit” style to
                        “Remojadas,” devolve from market practices established
                        by the SAG.

                        letters were scanned in early 2020, at the beginning of
                        the global COVID-19 pandemic. Staff members across the
                        GRI signed up to transcribe the family letters using the
                        Zooniverse crowdsourcing program. The handwriting of the
                        letters (they are rarely typed) is difficult to
                        decipher, and the spelling is erratic and nonstandard,
                        making transcription difficult. Using the Zooniverse
                        transcription as a basis, Getty staff have begun the
                        process of confirming transcriptions and assigning
                        identities to individuals named in the letters. Few
                        letters bear full dates, and most are indicated only by
                        “Thursday” or “March 3,” but the transcription team has
                        nevertheless been able to anchor most dates. I am
                        grateful to the Stendahl/Dammann family for their
                        careful retention of nearly eighty years of records and
                        their generous donation of these records to the GRI.

                    Dear Dad:<br>
                    Stopped at lumber yard and got plywood for box on way home
                    from Grandmothers and had Picasso at airport by 6 o’clock.
                    It probably will be delivered at Jaffees before noon on
                    Wednesday. Most of the information should be on back of
                    photo. Reproduced full page in “Picasso” by Zervos Vol 11
                    page 201 – was in collection of Roger Fry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Got check from Ericson for $550 also your letter today with
                    $250 from Reis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Glad you are not letting them beat you down of our choice
                    Mayan figures. Too bad you don’t have some of the others to
                    play with. Stolper came in today and said that Carlbach had
                    phoned him all excited and up in the air about the figures
                    and wanting to know if Bob could get some for him. Bob said
                    he was too busy and to buy them from you but Carlbach said
                    that he couldn’t touch them at the prices but wants a whole
                    collection. He also wants Bob to take him to Mexico.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Peterson sent up an article saying that 5 Mayan codices and
                    some fine vases have just been discovered in the Campeche
                    area. Don’t know whether this is Government or not or if it
                    came from Jaina but he says that everyone is Mayan crazy in
                    Mexico. I suppose we were damned lucky to get what we did at
                    our price. Wish we could keep in closer touch with Campeche
                    and skim off some more cream even with Hauswaldt and
                    Echaniz.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I wrote for and got some reactions from the last three

                    Sutter brought back Sweeneys figure today and I will ship
                    their stuff tomorrow. Sam Marx called today on route
                    <s>fom</s> to Chicago from trip around world. Couldn’t
                    persuade him to come up and see the stuff but he expects to
                    see you in Chicago. The architect John Rex’s partner was in
                    and very impressed tonight – they rent Frankls old place and
                    are doing great business.

                    Joe got a great order today setting up a new plant. Stein
                    will have a fit when he sees it. Am inclosing a letter about
                    Wendts – you can call him in Chicago. Wish you were going to
                    St Louis but it might not be worth it as long as they have
                    things still outstanding. Got $100 knocked off plumbing

                    did not. Had a chance to get plain to New Orleans so got
                    there about 7:30 P.M. Called Bliss to see if he would be
                    home on Thursday. Was so got into Washington about 6 A.M.

                    few other pieces. Bliss was very happy when he saw it so he
                    will pay me $2700.00 for it as I told him source had raised
                    price. Talked to Bliss about deal on Degas. He will call me

                    George Kennedy was in New York a short time ago and said

                    Dr. Kaiser and his wife were down last week from Berkeley.
                    Came in at 3 in the afternoon Sat and did not leave until 3
                    in the morning. What a session. They purchased $12,500.00. ,
                    of which will pay $5,000.00 in the spring and the rest
                    later. A good deal for us. Eleanor and I go to Midland on
                    Thursday next week to have Thanksgiving dinner with Rock and
                    will continue on to Berkeley to deliver the things. Also to
                    seethe other two couple up there. I am sure that they will
                    all turn into excellent clients. Also think that I can seel
                    the Mosaic Jaguar to the one couple but if you feel you need
                    it back there and have a chance to sell it, I can make
                    another trip later. Am looking trying to find something to
                    sell Adriana in Carmel but as yet have found nothing.

                    lso the 3 couples up North (Berekely) were most impressed
                    with our Otis show and think that the Village would be a
                    great thing for the New Oakland Museum. What is your idea
                    price-wise on the entire village as we had it set up at
                    Otis? I could start negoations on this next weekend.

                    of his a Mr. Dr. Arthur Sackler. We took him up to the
                    appartment and he had a very exciting evening looking at our
                    treasures. He liked the larg Amlash bull. The next day he
                    had Frank Caro come in to pass on it. Caro and his son were
                    as much excited as he was. Today Dr. Sackler came in and
                    bought it for $12000.00. Also the Jaguar head from Guatemala
                    for $1200.00. He also reserved the small gold cup from
                    Persia for $6000.00. He would rather have the larger cup for
                    $15000.00 but this is the one Rothcield of Paris reserved.
                    If Rothcild dose not take it he will. He also wants me to
                    get a lot of other things for him. He will start paying
                    after Jan 1st.

                  <p>And green mask- 1500.00</p>
                  <p>Evidently the Dr. Sackler will put up the money</p>
                  <p>
                    for these as he gave the Museum of American Indian money for
                    purchases- so you see we have been pretty busy and I am just
                    a little tired.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mrs michel sent me a dozen white Roses with a nice card- And
                    Jean Michell sent me two casees of wisky - one case 12
                    bottle of sckoch-pinch bottle and 12 bottles of of 100 proof
                    Old Grandad in full quartes. Also he wanted to give me a
                    dinner at Luchos for my friends so I invited- Easby &amp;
                    wife, Gordon Ekolm and wife Jane Powel and husband of the
                    Booklin Museum and Ernest and Miss Jones of the Primitive.
                    We were able to drink all the schoch and old Fashion with
                    two 12.00 bottles of Rothcilds wine and cavear ect. The
                    dinner must has come to over $125.00. Ever one had a good
                    time-
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also Michell gave me $80.00 to go to Europe to try to buy
                    the gold from my friend in Geneva and also to try to buy the
                    gold helmet a man as in Lucern - If I can get there I can
                    add on 20%. I phoned Carl Curtis for the two pieces he had
                    from a friend, but they we sold the day after I saw them. He
                    will try to get the two pieces from Friedman. He was
                    supposed to phone me, but did not so I think it was no go.
                    he might write to you as he has not my N.Y. Adress-
                  </p>

                  <p>Feb 22–1965</p>
                  <p>Dear Al &amp; Joe</p>
                  <p>
                    Arrived in Minnapolis and was only able to see Mr. Samuel
                    Sacks II-as the director was busy. Sacks II is the top man
                    any way so everything was O.K.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Interested in Stone Panels in Large Room – No-8560 the
                    standing Astec figure top of stairway – 2000.00 and the
                    Bronze vase we got in Biblos. I will send the photos from
                    here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Chicago Raymond Wielgus wants the Mayan Bowl with face
                    <s>and</s> we had at the Primitive. He just about commited
                    himself $2000.00. I will send this to him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wardwell of the Art Institute just about committed himself
                    on No-10015 the blond incised Mayan Cylinder Bowl -
                    $3000.00.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Phoned Detroit and the curator Francis W. Robinson requested
                    bill for the two Amlash pieces 1000.00 less than what we
                    quoted. I gave him an option of one week on the Maya stone
                    of which they have the Blow up. Quoted him 28000.00 down
                    from 35000.00. If they don’t buy he will send blow up on to
                    Minneapolis. He will send to me in N.Y. the gold plate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jan Mitchel was in today with instruction about the gold and
                    painting in Europe. He is hot. Hope you and Joe can do
                    something on an exchange with the Mex Museum. Have sent you
                    a catalogue of the large Egyptian Collection Sathoni has.
                    The Met has 5 or 6 of the items under consideration. The
                    catalogue is no good as it was printed in Egypt. We could
                    have it all sent out
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    as it would make a good study colechon for the University.
                    Have been sorting photos all day and bought two good Amlash
                    pieces from Sabhoni for $300.00. His niece is here going to
                    N. Y. U. and brought them with her. He might send out a few
                    pieces for repair. I gave him also 250.00 for ring we sold
                    to our Detroit man who has not paid. Tuesday will make an
                    appoinment with Abrams and also phone Washington.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The people from Toronto-Mr &amp; Mrs Noah Torno 146 Bloor
                    Street West, Toronto 5-Canada. Send them a group of
                    catalogus. They are hot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Cohens will come in about Middle of week and I know they
                    will buy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr Arthur Sackler was to come in late today but left B4 I
                    phoned him at 4:30. Glad you got a check from Dayton. Hope
                    Tom will do like wise. Will also phone Cleveland and Lef
                    heramanac is in hospital from a stroke. Alie Lewin is not
                    intown as his phone has been temporarily disconected.

                  <p>
                    Docksteder is in Winapeg Canada till the end of the week.
                    Mitchel will give me two hundred for the Blue clay piece. He
                    would like to have us send the Egption box with the
                    polychrome figure insid but I am afraid he would not buy
                    after seein gthe condition its in.

                    Dear Relatives –Your letter today. Eleanor thought I asked
                    you to open the packs – <u>please do</u> – your “Blumen” are
                    therin – 2 peasant aprons for you two kitchen wenches (if
                    you want them) a pepper mill for ME – 2 sheep horns – Linden
                    &amp; Leslie– You seem to be busy enough –<br>
                    The Spratling Trouble: He phoned – &amp; came to breakfast –
                    Tue a.m. – Said he had this stone – from Vera Cruz. Has been
                    in a dark warehouse 2 years – René D__ a count was to buy
                    it, but wired a curt, negative No. Stone in several pieces –
                    about impossible to see. Now will take $4000 for it – he
                    &amp; papa each take 1⁄2 – Papa say he will buy it – sight
                    unseen for $4000 – trouble usually comes otherwise. But –
                    Bill had a date at 11.30, with Emmerich – to see Stone-
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Papa say he will go halves with Emmerich - Bill departs,
                    saying he will call in the P.M. By that time, Papa mad. Says
                    with all we have done for Bill - he shows stuff to others
                    first– and as this stone has probably ben peddled about–he
                    will not take-So– when Bill called, asking us to breakfast
                    Wed. A.M. (Westbury). . Papa just say–“Two g.D. Early” and
                    hangs up-So-we do not know the Emmerich decision- It was a
                    covering for an opening in a Cave - <u>very</u> heavy- Would
                    have been something to handle - saw a drawing-head of a
                    tiger design. They both took “cracks” at Easby - Goldwater
                    of Primitive— and a <u>touch</u> at Eckholm!
