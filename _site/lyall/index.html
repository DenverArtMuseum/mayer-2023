      Collecting the Ancient Americas at the Denver Art Museum | Collecting the
      “Other Americas”
    </title>

    <meta name="description" content="The term *pre-Columbian art* once described the material culture produced in the Americas, mostly south of the US-Mexico border, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Museums across the United States now refer to these departments as art of *the Americas* or *the ancient Americas*. Stewards of these collections in American art museums have begun confronting the changing meanings and import of what Nelson Rockefeller once described as the “other Americas.” This symposium volume captures the history of collecting and display of ancient American works in art museums, a history surprisingly poorly documented until now.">

                    “Comparatively few art museums are so fortunate as to be
                    regarded as ministering in a real way to the requirement of
                    their communities, and yet, under the conditions of modern
                    life, it is only upon these terms that an art museum can, in
                    the long run, justify its existence.”—<em>George Eggers, Denver Art Museum director (1921–26)</em>

                  The Denver Art Museum (DAM) came into being decades after The
                  Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,
                  and the Art Institute of Chicago. First founded as the Denver
                  Artists’ Club, it would become the Denver Artists Association
                  in 1893, a scant seventeen years after the Colorado territory
                  had become a state. A place to “cultivate a general interest
                  and promotion of the arts,” the museum was powered by
                  volunteers who imbued it with an independent spirit it retains
                  today.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Denver’s location within the broader geography of the United
                  States plays an outsize role in the institution’s identity and
                  its approach to its collections, audiences, and patrons.
                  Located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, it is surrounded
                  by a vast expanse of land: About eight hundred miles separate
                  it from the next largest global art museum (fig. 1).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  The city sits spitting distance from the center of the
                  country. Because of its geography, the DAM felt a
                  responsibility beyond its immediate surroundings: “What the
                  Metropolitan Museum is to New York, the Art Institute to
                  Chicago, the Louvre to Paris, and the British Museum to
                  London, the Denver Art Museum is to Denver and the whole Rocky
                  Mountain region.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  Today it stands as the largest encyclopedic art museum between
                  Chicago and Los Angeles. Like the other institutions discussed
                  in this volume, early directors, curators, and collectors
                  played an essential role in assembling and shaping the ancient
                  Americas collection. But I would also argue that the museum’s
                  geographic location played an equally significant role. This
                  essay is an exercise in retrieving and reconstructing an often
                  invisible and forgotten history that I hope will remind us of
                  the very human aspect of museums.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1968, then-director Otto Bach (1909–1990) formed the New
                  World Department, which brought together existing Latin
                  American and pre-Columbian material under one umbrella. A
                  collection of southwestern santos donated by an early patron,
                  Anne Evans, and the several hundred works of pre-Columbian
                  objects were recategorized as “New World.” This designation, a
                  phrase borrowed from the writings of European explorers,
                  described the “discovery” of new lands, territories claimed
                  for European empires. Its use was unique within American art
                  museums; at the DAM, it would refer to the territory of the
                  Americas south of the US-Mexico border. Today, the term
                  reminds us of the five-hundred-year colonization and
                  subjugation of American peoples and, rightfully, has been
                  abandoned. The decision in 1968 to use the term to describe a
                  disparate collection of objects united only by their shared
                  geography, however, represented a groundbreaking perspective.
                  It conceptually connected the makers of southwestern santos to
                  the ancient artists of Mexico, Guatemala, and beyond. In fact,
                  Bach’s foresight and those of subsequent curators is what
                  distinguishes Denver’s holdings today: It stands as one of the
                  most expansive and comprehensive collections of the Americas
                  within the United States, capturing the history of the region
                  from the beginning of agriculture to the formation of
                  nineteenth-century republics.

                  Although the department came into being during the midcentury,
                  the heyday of pre-Columbian art, its history begins much
                  earlier. The youngest daughter of Colorado governor John
                  Evans, Anne Evans (1871–1941) was born in London and educated
                  between the mountainous landscape of Colorado and the rarified
                  art collections of Europe and the American East Coast. She
                  studied art at the New York Art Students League and summered
                  at the Evanses’ Colorado ranch.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Evans and her mother devoted themselves to developing
                  Colorado’s cultural sphere, and she would ultimately play a
                  pivotal role in the founding of the Denver Art Museum, serving
                  as the executive secretary, interim director, and ongoing
                  consultant. As the museum took shape, Evans herself began to
                  collect southwestern santos and American Indian art, becoming
                  one of its most ardent promoters. She encouraged the DAM to
                  fund acquisitions, exhibitions, and finally, in 1925, to hire
                  a full-time curator of American Indian art. Upon her death,
                  she donated her entire collection of santos and bultos to the
                  museum (fig. 2). This collection, which showcases the mastery
                  of southwestern wood carvers and painters, draws on both
                  Catholic and Native American imagery, reflecting the region’s
                  and the artists’ own multicultural backgrounds. Through her
                  efforts, Evans ensured the Denver Art Museum’s place as a
                  groundbreaking institution that valued American Indian culture
                  and history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s difficult to consider Anne’s identity as a collector and
                  promoter of American Indian and southwestern art separate from
                  her father’s legacy. Dr. John Evans, the second territorial
                  governor of Colorado, appointed by Abraham Lincoln, was a
                  physician and railroad titan who would play a hand in the
                  founding of both Northwestern University and University of
                  Denver; however, the Sand Creek Massacre would become his
                  lasting legacy. On November 29, 1864, hundreds of Cheyenne and
                  Arapahoe people were murdered by the US Army. Evans was out of
                  the state on business, but as several studies have concluded,
                  his lack of enforcing Indian treaties and habitual neglect of
                  the Cheyenne and Arapahoe peoples contributed to this
                  tragedy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  His daughter’s efforts to uplift and validate the material
                  culture and aesthetics of Native communities from this region
                  and beyond resulted in the creation of three separate
                  departments at the museum: Native Arts, Ancient Americas, and
                  Latin American Art. One hundred and sixty years later, these
                  collections continue to amplify the stories and voices of
                  Indigenous peoples of the Americas.

                <p>
                  Frederic “Eric” Douglas (1897–1956), a native Coloradan,
                  joined the museum in 1929 as curator of American Indian art.
                  He would go on to serve the institution for three decades as
                  curator and interim director until his death in 1956.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Douglas was perhaps most well-known for his role in organizing
                  <em>Indian Art of the United States</em>, the 1941 Museum of
                  Modern Art exhibition he cocurated with René d’Harnoncourt,
                  but his true contribution was the establishment of a singular
                  curatorial perspective at the DAM that integrated Native
                  American art into the museum’s fine art collection (fig.
                  3).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Unlike contemporaries around the United States that
                  categorized Indigenous art as “decorative,” Douglas advocated
                  tirelessly for viewing these works on par with that of the
                  great masterpieces of Europe and for the living artists who
                  produced them as individuals possessing a rare skill and
                  expertise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His attitude and character are most clearly captured in his
                  correspondence with the newly appointed director Otto Bach
                  while Douglas was stationed overseas in 1944. Douglas
                  vehemently objected to Bach’s application of the term
                  “primitive” on two accounts. First, by applying the term to
                  the Department of Indian Art, in Douglas’s opinion, Bach
                  lumped the DAM with other museums that had similar
                  departments. Douglas noted that among American art museums,
                  only Denver had “postulated that the American Indian had arts
                  worthy of serious esthetic consideration.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  This objection captures Douglas’s zeal and dedication to the
                  department he had almost single-handedly created and what
                  today we may refer to as his legacy. To his credit, his second
                  objection was: “The use of the word primitive has a
                  connotation of condescension and snobbery both artistic and
                  social. . . . It is a very poor thing to look down our noses
                  however politely at the works of other than our own race,
                  especially if that other is not what is laughingly called
                  white. . . . It’s the wrong use of the word however you look
                  at it and I’ll have no part of it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  In addition to clarifying Douglas’s position, this exchange
                  also provides insight into the fraught relationship between
                  the two men.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Douglas’s extraordinary vision and open-mindedness
                  resulted in the creation of a singular department, he largely
                  ignored historical and contemporary Indigenous peoples living
                  south of the US-Mexico border. Eleanor Roosevelt penned the
                  foreword to <em>Indian Art of the United States</em> and
                  pointedly referenced the interchange of goods and ideas north
                  <em>and</em> south, perhaps a nod to her husband’s promotion
                  of inter-American cooperation; however, Douglas’s
                  correspondence clearly indicates that, in his mind, a bright
                  line separated the two Americas, and he collected exclusively
                  <em>north</em> of the US-Mexico border.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  But when the museum received several gifts of ancient American
                  material, they were administered by the Native Arts department
                  until 1968.

                <h2>Otto Bach: Building a New World</h2>
                <p>
                  <em>Denver Post</em> journalist Bill Hornby wrote an
                  appreciation of Otto Bach after his passing in 1990 and noted:
                  “The man who really put our Art Museum on the world cultural
                  map was Dr. Otto Karl Bach, its director and guiding spirit
                  from 1944–1974. Whether it was in acquiring renowned
                  collections, buying land for expansion, insisting on
                  developing the museum education program for all the people or
                  instilling the tradition that Denver was going to have a world
                  class art collection, Otto and Cile Bach were the driving
                  spirits of the modern Denver Art Museum.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Bach’s thirty-year tenure would transform the museum from a
                  local, provincial institution to one of national renown.
                  Moreover, it would be through Bach and his ministrations that
                  the ancient Americas collection would take shape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bach moved to Denver with his wife, Cile, and their young son
                  from Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1944. In a letter to Douglas
                  introducing himself, Bach explained that his training was in
                  European art, but he had served as a museum administrator for
                  twelve years, first in Milwaukee and later in Grand
                  Rapids.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  His goal, clearly laid out in 1944, was to build a new
                  permanent home for the DAM, which he would achieve in 1971
                  with the opening of the Gio Ponti–designed building.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Somewhere along the way, Bach developed a love for art of the
                  ancient Americas (fig. 4). From his first acquisition in 1951
                  until 1974, when he retired, Bach almost single-handedly built
                  the ancient Americas collection that came to number over one
                  thousand pieces. A museum built on volunteerism, the DAM
                  remained people rich and dollar poor. As a result, Bach would
                  cajole dealers and trade, exchange, buy on credit, and
                  deaccession objects to get the works he wanted.

                <p>
                  In 1956, three months after Douglas’s passing, Dr. Karl Arndt,
                  board president, asked Bach to review the collections in the
                  Native Arts Department with recommendations for culling,
                  keeping, exchanging, and lending.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Bach explained that the American Indian collection consisted
                  of thousands of objects with scores of duplications—some
                  identical: “Mr. Conn and Mr. Bach believe that each category
                  of material should be checked carefully, in small units, with
                  an eye to weeding out duplicates and sub-standard material and
                  replacing it with objects which are of better quality or more
                  uniqueness, or filling in gaps in pre-Columbian, Mexican
                  pre-historic, Mound Builders or other areas which are lacking
                  in representative material.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  As Lewis Story, DAM’s assistant director at the time,
                  observed, Bach’s decision to further develop collections of
                  African, Oceanic, and pre-Columbian holdings allowed him to
                  serve “a multicultural constituency more effectively.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Over the next several years, Bach would work to drum up
                  support via the museum’s various affiliated committees

                <p>
                  As other authors in this volume note, America at midcentury
                  was captivated by the ancient Americas (see essays by Rosoff,
                  Koontz, and Robb). A steady stream of exhibitions traveled
                  around the country, or were organized locally, to showcase the
                  wonders of “lost” or “mysterious” civilizations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Beginning in 1950, Bach worked to bring many of these shows to
                  Denver. Exhibitions featuring Middle American gold, ancient
                  Peruvian artwork, and “Pre-Columbian and Contemporary Art”
                  began appearing in the Schleier Memorial Gallery with some
                  frequency between 1950 and 1960 (fig. 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  During the run of the exhibitions, Bach befriended the dealers
                  and collectors who lent work to the shows, ultimately securing
                  one or two pieces for the DAM’s growing collection. The
                  museum’s annual reports began featuring names such as Julius
                  Carlebach and Earl Stendahl.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Additionally, Bach, ever the promoter, penned short articles
                  for <em>The Denver Post</em>, celebrating the acquisition of
                  pre-Columbian objects at the museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  While Bach acquired these works through trades and exchanges,
                  these acquisitions provoked the ire of the board.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  These transactions became so prevalent that, during one
                  contentious board meeting in 1967, a trustee lamented the
                  number of times he went to the gallery and realized a beloved
                  piece was missing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  He called for greater transparency for trades and exchanges.
                  Unfortunately, his words were not heeded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bach continued growing the collection of art from the Americas
                  incrementally. By 1967, there were 153 pre-Columbian works in
                  the DAM’s collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  In 1968, he decided to join the pre-Columbian objects from
                  Mexico and Central and South America with Anne Evans’s
                  southwestern santos collection to officially create the New
                  World Department. With this new arrangement, the story of the
                  art of the Americas could now be seen sequentially, connecting
                  the ancient with the more recent past.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Bach hired Robert Stroessner (1942–1991), who received a
                  degree in interior design from the University of Denver, as
                  the inaugural New World curator (fig. 7). An assistant curator
                  in Native Arts under Norman Feder, Stroessner had been Bach’s
                  student and protégé and, like Bach, understood the history of
                  the Americas as part of a single continuum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  He took pride in Denver’s regional approach, writing to donors
                  that the museum’s decision to include both ancient and
                  colonial art from Latin America under the same umbrella was
                  unusual. In a 1974 letter to the new director, Tom Maytham,
                  Stroessner underscored the New World Department’s unique
                  approach: “We have tried to systematically select
                  representative examples to form a chain of pieces which link
                  as many historical connections as possible through the entire
                  history of Latin America.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  In a separate letter to collector and patron Olive Bigelow
                  Pell, he lamented that the most important collections of this
                  material live in natural history or folk art museums,
                  underscoring the uniqueness of the DAM’s approach and the
                  importance it played modeling an innovative approach for its
                  peers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Noted for his charm and panache, Stroessner forged
                  relationships across the United States and Latin America.
                  Though 1968 was late to be assembling a collection of
                  pre-Columbian art and with few funds at his disposal,
                  Stroessner, like Bach before him, relied on partnerships,
                  museum exchanges, and creative funding. Three collectors
                  played significant roles in building the pre-Columbian
                  holdings: Morton “Buster” May and Mr. and Mrs. Frederick
                  Mayer.

                  The grandson of David May, a German Jewish émigré who settled
                  in Colorado in 1877, Morton, known as “Buster,” assumed the
                  chairmanship of the May Company department store conglomerate
                  in 1951. While Morton May was born in St. Louis, his roots
                  were in Leadville, Colorado. David May moved his family from
                  Ohio to Leadville for health reasons and established a dry
                  goods supply for the region’s miners.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  Two years after his arrival, the Leadville mine struck silver,
                  and by 1880, the town had grown to nearly thirty thousand
                  people. Eventually, May would purchase another store in Denver
                  in 1887, and by 1911 the May Department Stores would be a
                  publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.
                  Despite the family’s relocation to St. Louis, the Mays
                  remained a part of Colorado’s Jewish community.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  David May helped found the Hebrew Benevolent Association in
                  Leadville and maintained the town’s synagogue (fig. 8).

                  In 1957, the May Company purchased the Daniels and Fischer
                  store on 16th Street in downtown Denver. Known locally as May
                  D&amp;F, the store became a city fixture. Located on
                  Zeckendorff Plaza, the campus included a pavilion shaped like
                  a hyperbolic paraboloid, designed by architect I. M. Pei and
                  an artificial ski slope during the winter months (fig. 9). The
                  structure was destroyed to make way for a pedestrian street
                  mall.

                <p>
                  A collector of primitive art, May arrived in Denver just as
                  Otto Bach was trying to rally support for a world-class
                  collection of pre-Columbian art. Indeed, the entirety of May’s
                  documented relationship with the DAM transpired during the
                  course of Bach’s tenure: His earliest gift happened in 1946
                  and his last in 1971.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  May donated extensively to the Native Arts Department,
                  corresponding with the department’s curator, Norman Feder, and
                  connecting Feder with other collectors and dealers that
                  reached out to May but were not of interest to him.

There is a wealth of art from Mexico and Peru interspersed with pieces from Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador. Many of the pieces have been determined to be of excellent museum quality. Viewing this collection of art from about 900 BC through the fifteenth century is an adventure for anyone. Pottery is in abundance in human and animal shapes. Stone, wood, gold and other metals are represented. Particularly outstanding is a collection of jade, stone and metal jewelry. Ancient Peruvian textiles are a strong part of the exhibition which ranges in price from $5 to $8,000. The art of Central America and the West Coast of South America, dating before Columbus’ discovery of America, has long been recognized as one of the highest artistic achievements of man. It is perhaps the favorite art form of people in this Rocky Mountain Empire, because of the early Spanish heritage of the land and because of the excellent collection in the pre-Columbian gallery in the south wing, Denver Museum of Art.

                <p>
                  As Matthew Robb’s essay in this volume makes clear, May’s
                  formation as a commercial businessman influenced how he viewed
                  his collections: as commodities that would be bought and sold.
                  This prompted the development of a touring art sale that would
                  visit May Company stores in Saint Louis, Denver and,
                  ultimately, Los Angeles (fig. 10). James Economos, May’s
                  curator and consultant for the art sale, corresponded with
                  curators at institutions nationwide. Economos, May, and the
                  Textile Museum’s curator, Alan Sawyer, were photographed in
                  the courtyard of the May Company’s Wilshire Boulevard
                  department store, and the brazier in Economos’s hand (DAM
                  1990.70) ended up in the DAM collection via the Los Angeles
                  dealer Earl Stendahl (see figure 7 in Robb).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  In 1969, Morton May gifted the DAM thirteen pieces of
                  Mesoamerican art in honor of David S. Touff, who retired as
                  the May Company board chairman that year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  Between 1968 and 1971, May and the Denver branch of May
                  D&amp;F were frequent donors to the DAM’s nascent New World
                  Department, directly gifting the museum over fifty individual
                  works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, in Bach’s obituary, then board chair Frederick Mayer
                  recalled how he, May, and Bach worked together to build the
                  ancient Americas collection and create the New World
                  Department: “Buster May of the May Co. department stores had a
                  large collection of Peruvian pre-Columbian pieces and Otto
                  pestered him for years to get the collection for DAM. . . .
                  Buster always told him the pieces were for sale not donation.
                  . . . Finally, the store decided to get rid of the collection
                  and Bach negotiated a price of 30,000 for 800 Peruvian pots
                  and textiles.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  The acquisition was more complex than this and included a
                  substantial gift by Frederick and Jan Mayer to the museum.
                  May’s collection numbered 1,300 works of ancient Peruvian art.
                  May was willing to sell the collection to the DAM at a
                  discounted price, but the museum lacked the necessary funds.
                  Frederick Mayer purchased the entire collection and gifted
                  sixty-two pieces, selected by Bach and Stroessner, to the DAM.
                  Forty-four pieces went to a Texas collector, and the remaining
                  objects were gifted or sold.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  The Andean material included in this acquisition may have come
                  from the enormous Peruvian collection assembled by Dr. Edouard
                  Gaffron and acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago (see
                  Elizabeth Pope, this volume), parts of which had been
                  deaccessioned and purchased by Morton May.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  This complicated transaction, which began in 1969 and was
                  completed in 1970, became one of the New World Department’s
                  foundational collections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>

                  By 1969, the New World collection had grown sufficiently to
                  occupy dedicated galleries in the new Ponti building, which
                  opened to the public in 1971. Stroessner used his background
                  in interior design to present the newly enlarged collection in
                  dramatic installations, winning over patrons and visitors
                  alike. Large-scale maquettes of Uxmal’s Magician’s Pyramid
                  (fig. 11) and a Maya-period room (fig. 12), complete with
                  painted moss, evoked the magnificence of the material for
                  Denver audiences.

                  Stroessner’s greatest contribution, however, would be the
                  cultivation of a young couple from Texas, Frederick and Jan
                  Mayer, who would go on to endow the department (fig.13). The
                  Mayers were early supporters of Stroessner and eventually
                  became the department’s most significant donors. From an early
                  age, Frederick had collected Costa Rican stamps and had been
                  interested in Central America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  In 1966, he and his wife vacationed in Costa Rica. “In those
                  days,” he recalled, “there were stores that sold pre-Columbian
                  artifacts.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  The couple focused their collecting on art from this region in
                  an effort to assemble a comprehensive collection of ancient
                  Costa Rican art. Mayer would enlist the help of archaeologists
                  and students to not only find works but to promote the
                  investigation and understanding of the region’s development.
                  Mayer’s intellectual curiosity knew no bounds, and he
                  collected with almost scientific precision. Like May, he
                  amassed all examples of a given style, period, or type, in
                  this case, ceramics, greenstone, and metallurgy from the Costa
                  Rican region. The size and comprehensiveness of the collection
                  gave it an inestimable educational value for scholars of
                  Central America. During the 1980s and ’90s, the Mayers funded
                  numerous studies, symposia, and exchanges between Costa Rican
                  and American students and scholars. Frederick served as
                  Chairman of the Board of Trustees for many years, and his
                  generosity was not limited to the department or even to the
                  DAM.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>

                  Beginning in the early 1990s, a large portion of the Mayers’
                  collection of three thousand pieces were placed with the
                  museum on long-term loan and were featured prominently in the
                  department’s re-installed galleries, which opened in 1993 in
                  time for the museum’s centennial.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  The new installation, geared toward scholars, dedicated nearly
                  half of the floor space to study storage. Seven
                  cruciform-shaped glass cases displayed nearly 90 percent of
                  the ancient Americas collection. Arranged from Inca to the
                  Olmec, the cases displayed many of the works flat on shelves
                  with maps and other didactic material available on the
                  perimeter walls (fig. 14). The arrangement permitted the
                  viewing and comparison of pieces often relegated to storage
                  that the public could not access.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Mayers funded the creation of a Center for Pre-Columbian
                  and Spanish Colonial Art in 2001, the second and successful
                  iteration of such a center. The earlier version, the Center
                  for the Study of Latin American Art and Archaeology, had been
                  staffed by archaeologists, Gordon McEwan, an Andean
                  specialist, and Fred W. Lange, an assistant professor at the
                  University of Colorado, Boulder, who focused on Mayer’s region
                  of interest, Central America. McEwan had been appointed New
                  World curator after Stroessner’s passing in 1991 and oversaw
                  the 1993 reinstallation; he left the museum in 1997. Dorie
                  Reents-Budet served as interim curator for two years,
                  <a href="https://d26jxt5097u8sr.cloudfront.net/2023-03/10%2027%201998%20Repatriation%20of%20El%20Zotz%20lintel%20to%20Guatemala.pdf" target="_blank">overseeing the restitution of a wooden Maya lintel from El
                    Tzotz to the National Museum of Guatemala</a>. Finally in 2001, the DAM decided to split the New World
                  Department into two separate collections overseen by dedicated
                  specialists. Margaret Young-Sánchez became the curator of
                  pre-Columbian art and Donna Pierce the curator of Spanish
                  colonial art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Young-Sánchez and Pierce, together, shaped what would become
                  the Mayer Center. Both curators added significantly to their
                  respective collections, enhancing the breadth and quality of
                  the New World Department.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  While both organized impactful international exhibitions,
                  <em>Tiwanaku</em> (2002) and
                  <em>Painting a New World</em> (2004), arguably their greatest
                  contribution was shaping the identity and vision of the Mayer
                  Center and its associated activities. The Center’s purpose
                  was, and remains, to increase awareness and promote
                  scholarship in these fields by sponsoring academic activities,
                  including symposia, fellowships, conservation, and
                  publications. The generosity of the Mayers ensured that the
                  symposia could bring together scholars from across the world,
                  galvanizing conversations across disciplines and institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By 2017, the DAM hired two new curators to succeed
                  Young-Sánchez and Pierce, Jorge Rivas Pérez and myself.
                  Together, we decided to revamp tradition by considering the
                  relevance of our respective collections to present
                  communities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  As we entered the museum’s next phase, the reinstallation of
                  the permanent collection galleries, we reevaluated the
                  antiquated terms used to describe our collections and
                  reaffirmed our commitment to promoting art of the Americas,
                  replacing “pre-Columbian” and “Spanish colonial” with “ancient
                  American” and “Latin American.” While the ancient Americas
                  collection primarily focuses on objects produced during the
                  four thousand years of civilization preceding the Spanish, its
                  expanded scope includes works by contemporary artists whose
                  practice or technique resonates with those of ancient artists.

                  The reinstallation, completed in 2021, no longer includes the
                  study storage cases (fig. 15). The glass shelves that
                  showcased so many objects intimidated visitors and were
                  replaced with a color-coded presentation structured around
                  geography (Mesoamerica, Central America, and South America)
                  and three central ideas: land, legacy, and trade. The question
                  of “land” addresses the impact that environment, geography,
                  and landscape have on our understanding of the world and our
                  place in it. From volcanoes to mangroves and coastal deserts,
                  the varied landscapes of the Americas played a powerful role
                  in the narratives and cosmovision of peoples across the
                  continent. “Legacy” considers how the past continues to shape
                  the present. The images, shapes, forms, and materials of
                  ancient artists persist in the work of contemporary artists
                  and the visual vocabulary of descendant communities on both
                  sides of the border. Finally, the concept of “trade” addresses
                  the continual exchange of goods and ideas that linked ancient
                  communities across time and space. Recent scholarship has
                  underscored the sophistication of ancient navigation and
                  technological innovation that permitted connections to be made
                  across vast, previously unimaginable, distances.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, the department continues to embrace the groundbreaking
                  approach of the early curators who respected and regarded in
                  the highest esteem the works of Indigenous artists from the
                  Americas. Bach and Stroessner’s vision for a holistic approach
                  that presented the historical and artistic complexity of the
                  region across time has likewise left an indelible mark. But
                  perhaps the strongest influence for the ancient Americas
                  collection at present is the relationship to the descendant
                  communities locally, nationally, and internationally that seek
                  solace and connection in the works of ancient artists.

                        In the director’s report delivered during a 1967 April
                        board meeting, Bach discussed recent museum accessions,
                        all in the field of pre-Columbian art. Since accession
                        funds were zero and had been since the Development Fund
                        campaign started, the only way to keep the collection
                        alive was to trade or exchange material. In this case,
                        Bach traded or exchanged duplicate prints from the
                        museum’s collection in order to acquire an early
                        Peruvian cup (<a href="https://www.denverartmuseum.org/en/object/1967.107" target="_blank">1967.107</a>), a rare Nayarit village Dance (1967.109), a small and
                        costly Maya figure (1967.108), a Costa Rican incense
                        burner representing the crocodile god (deaccessioned), a
                        Costa Rican animal effigy jar (deaccessioned), a
                        snake-headed jar (deaccessioned), and a ceremonial
                        metate in the shape of a jaguar (deaccessioned). Board

                        Mr. Billmyer, a member of the board, offered “random
                        thoughts and questions” regarding the museum’s Accession
                        Committee during the meeting held on May 24, 1967. He
                        asked whether the DAM should continue to be a collecting
                        institution, “since it is always suffering from a lack
                        of acquisition funds.” And he personally deplored the
                        idea of “trading,” so he asked for a published statement
                        regarding the museum’s policy and purpose of acquiring
                        art objects. Board Meeting, May 24, 1967, ibid.

                        This figure was compiled by reviewing the annual reports
                        and inventory of objects included for each department.
                        Because of the chaotic nature of trades and exchanges
                        that did not always leave a legible trace in the
                        collections record, we found these lists to be more
                        reliable. In the 1967 Annual Report, New World appears
                        as one of the departments, but no specific works are
                        listed.

                        that the institution employed thirty-three people as
                        staff and lists Robert Stroessner as Assistant Curator
                        of American Indian Art. Annual Meeting Minutes 1968–69,
                        D13.FB2, Denver Art Museum Archives. While born in
                        Colorado, Robert Stroessner’s family had connections to
                        Latin America. A part of Stroessner’s family emigrated
                        from Germany to Colorado, while another branch moved to
                        Paraguay. Alfredo Stroessner, Paraguay’s longtime
                        dictator, was Robert’s granduncle. The family remained
                        in contact with their South American relatives.
                        Stroessner visited Paraguay, and on at least on one
                        occasion, his granduncle visited the US. See La Hay
                        Wauhillau, “Denver’s Stroessner Rub Shoulders with
                        President,” <em>The Denver Post</em>, March 21, 1968. It
                        is not known, however, how much Robert or his parents
                        knew of his granduncle’s activities in the country. See

                        In this history of the Mayers’ involvement with the DAM,
                        this gift stands out for its financial complexity. It is
                        worth noting that there is no evidence that the Mayers
                        ever performed such fiscal feats again to bring a
                        collection to the museum. Given the timing of the
                        exchange, I would speculate that May, a successful
                        businessman fourteen years Mayer’s senior, may have
                        exerted a certain influence on the nature of the
                        purchase and the eventual gift.

                        Young-Sánchez broadened the collection geographically
                        and materially by acquiring a group of Marajoara works
                        from Brazil, including a funerary urn (<a href="https://www.denverartmuseum.org/en/object/2006.14" target="_blank">2006.14</a>), and several extraordinary textiles, including an
                        Intermediate period textile from southern Peru (<a href="https://www.denverartmuseum.org/en/object/2013.448" target="_blank">2013.448</a>). Pierce added significantly to the department’s
                        holdings of viceregal Mexican material, including
                        notable works such as

See this exhibition beginning tomorrow in the downtown store, second floor gallery.  Approximately 2,000 pieces have been selected and purchased under the personal supervision of Mr. Morton D.

There is a wealth of art from Mexico and Peru interspersed with pieces from Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador. Many of the pieces have been determined to be of excellent museum quality. Viewing this collection of art from about 900 BC through the fifteenth century is an adventure for anyone. Pottery is in abundance in human and animal shapes. Stone, wood, gold and other metals are represented. Particularly outstanding is a collection of jade, stone and metal jewelry.
