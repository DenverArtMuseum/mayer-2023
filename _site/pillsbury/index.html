      Ancient American Art In and Out and Back In Again at The Met | Collecting
      the “Other Americas”
    </title>

    <meta name="description" content="The term *pre-Columbian art* once described the material culture produced in the Americas, mostly south of the US-Mexico border, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Museums across the United States now refer to these departments as art of *the Americas* or *the ancient Americas*. Stewards of these collections in American art museums have begun confronting the changing meanings and import of what Nelson Rockefeller once described as the “other Americas.” This symposium volume captures the history of collecting and display of ancient American works in art museums, a history surprisingly poorly documented until now.">

                    Avoiding the popular “Wolfe collection,” whose anecdotic
                    canvases filled one of the main galleries of the queer
                    wilderness of cast-iron and encaustic tiles known as the
                    Metropolitan Museum, they had wandered down a passage to the
                    room where the “Cesnola antiquities” mouldered in unvisited
                    loneliness.

                    They had this melancholy retreat to themselves, and seated
                    on the divan enclosing the central steam-radiator, they were
                    staring silently at the glass cabinets mounted in ebonized

                <p>
                  With the return of peace after the dislocations of the US
                  Civil War, The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870
                  by businessmen, civic leaders, and artists in New York. Unlike
                  its European counterparts, the institution had no royal
                  collections on which to build and no dedicated space. Yet the
                  founders had noble, and ambitious, intentions: The Met was to
                  represent the world’s art history—of all periods and all
                  places. In 1880, the museum opened to the public at its
                  current site at 82nd Street and Fifth Avenue. The scene
                  described by Edith Wharton in her 1920 novel should be
                  imagined as being set shortly after this. Positioned on the
                  edge of Central Park, the museum was linked with other
                  currents of improvement in New York, including the park itself
                  (fig. 1). The museum grew quickly, as vastly increased wealth
                  of the economic elite in the city was translated into rapidly
                  expanding art collections, both private and public.

                  Nearly two thousand works of pre-Columbian art were acquired
                  as gifts and purchases by 1900, including gifts from the
                  Hudson River School painter Frederic Church, a trustee of the
                  museum and an enthusiastic early supporter of ancient American
                  art, and the purchase of a collection of Mexican antiquities
                  (and pseudo antiquities) from Luigi Petich, an Italian
                  diplomat.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Hailed in the nineteenth century as American antiquities for
                  an American museum, the pre-Columbian collection was seen as
                  essential to the young and still inchoate organization
                  establishing its institutional identity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Yet this interest waxed and waned, only to wax again by the
                  last quarter of the twentieth century.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a brief overview of The Met’s early presentation of
                  ancient American art and its subsequent reversal—the half
                  century in which the museum largely turned away from the
                  field—this essay addresses The Met’s later embrace of the arts
                  of ancient Latin America. The Met eventually returned to the
                  field in the belated wake of modernism, most impactfully via
                  Nelson A. Rockefeller and the 1969 transfer of the collections
                  of the Museum of Primitive Art to The Met. This essay focuses
                  largely on the period after 1914 and before 1969—a time when
                  The Met’s ambivalence about the place of ancient American art
                  within its walls reveals changing conceptions about what
                  constitutes the history of art and the place of ancient
                  American civilizations in world history.

                  The collection of “American antiquities” was initially
                  displayed in the basement hall of The Met’s first Central Park
                  building, alongside arms and armor and the collection of casts
                  and other reproductions, including photographs and copies of
                  Maya murals created by photographer-explorers Désiré Charnay
                  and Augustus Le Plongeon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  After the museum’s expansion in 1888 (see figure 1), the
                  pre-Columbian collection, which was to increase substantially
                  in the next decade, was moved upstairs, adjacent to the
                  paintings galleries and, later, musical instruments (fig.
                  2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  In the late nineteenth century, the museum visiting experience
                  was often a cold and dark one: The large gallery initially was
                  lit only by skylights—the museum was not yet electrified—and
                  dependent on inadequate steam heat. The sizeable number of
                  objects from the permanent collection was augmented by loans
                  on occasion, and the works were carefully mounted and laid out
                  by type (fig. 3).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  As John Taylor Johnson and Louis P. di Cesnola, the museum’s
                  first president and director, respectively, wrote in 1882,
                  appealing to the museum’s membership to establish a department
                  of “old American art”: “The history of the ancient American
                  civilizations can and will be recovered and read if we gather
                  and arrange in order their works of art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

It would be impossible even to quote the many expressions of admiration that these heads have called forth from newspapers, reviews and scholars.

                  Assessments of the ancient American art at the time were often
                  quite positive. The guidebook to the museum’s collections
                  notes that “the accounts of the Spanish Conquerors as to the
                  high civilization of the old Peruvians find abundant
                  corroboration in these remains.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  The stars of the collection were what were then called “Toltec
                  Smiling Faces,” a type of sculpture that was largely unknown
                  until that time (figs. 4 and 5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Made in Veracruz in the seventh or eighth century in a style
                  now called Remojadas, these enigmatic figures would go on to
                  capture visitors’ imaginations for over a century.

                  Despite the initial interest in ancient American art, the
                  museum began to reconsider it in the second decade of the
                  twentieth century, as new leadership at the museum questioned
                  whether such objects belonged in an art museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  In 1914, most of the ancient American works were sent across
                  Central Park to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH),
                  losing their designation as “art” as part of that transition.
                  Some works, especially items of gold or silver, were retained
                  a bit longer, but those, too, were eventually sent on
                  long-term loan, this time to the Brooklyn Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  The art of ancient Latin America would go on to have only a

                  There were some interesting exceptions to the mass relegation
                  of ancient American objects to other institutions, however.
                  Some twenty Maya and Mixtec items collected by the businessman
                  and philanthropist Heber R. Bishop remained in the museum
                  along with the Asian jades that formed the bulk of his
                  collection. Indeed, a reproduction of a Mixtec figurine in
                  that collection was reportedly one of the most popular items
                  in the museum’s book shop in the 1950s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  Ancient Peruvian textiles, which The Met began to collect as
                  early as 1882, not only remained in the museum but continued
                  to be collected, at least sporadically. Following the model of
                  London’s South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert
                  Museum), The Met adopted a similar guiding principle that
                  museums could positively influence industrial design. The
                  garment business was New York’s largest industry; the creation
                  of The Met’s Textile Study Room in 1910 was fueled by the idea
                  that the study of the decorative arts would lead to better
                  design in factories and workshops (fig. 6).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The textile collection grew over the years, eventually
                  becoming the subject of a special exhibition in 1931, complete
                  with a catalog intended primarily for “students of ornament,”
                  a reminder of the abiding influence of Owen Jones, the
                  nineteenth-century architect, designer, and theorist, whose
                  sourcebook <em>The Grammar of Ornament</em> (1856) was
                  intended to make design principles in the decorative arts,
                  viewed globally, more widely available.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  By the 1950s, however, textiles were collected not simply for
                  study purposes but as works of art in their own right. As
                  modern art became more widely embraced, the path was laid for
                  seeing ancient Andean textiles in a new way. In 1959, John
                  Phillips, a curator in the Department of Renaissance and
                  Post-Renaissance Art who had worked on the 1931 exhibition,
                  recommended the purchase of eight Peruvian textiles. Perhaps
                  signaling a changing attitude at the museum, Phillips noted,
                  “In our day, when highly conventionalized forms have become
                  familiar through the agency of contemporary painting and
                  sculpture, these textiles seem far less <em>outré</em> than
                  they once did.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It should be noted, however, that The Met was hardly an early
                  adopter of what we now think of as modern art. Indeed, it is
                  important to bear in mind that the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)
                  was born in part out of frustrations with The Met’s obdurate
                  refusal to entertain contemporary art. Later in the century,
                  it would be MoMA, and its neighbor the Museum of Primitive
                  Art, that would mount important exhibitions of ancient
                  American art. One interesting aspect of this change was that
                  The Met’s move was strikingly at odds with some broader
                  currents in the United States at the time. While The Met
                  remained quiet for decades, other institutions, including the
                  Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the
                  Philadelphia Museum of Art, and even the National Gallery of
                  Art in Washington, DC, were doubling down on collecting and
                  exhibiting pre-Columbian art, if only, as was the case with
                  the National Gallery, for a limited time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>

                <p>
                  By 1952, leadership at The Met began to think that perhaps it
                  had been a mistake to relegate its pre-Columbian collection to
                  other institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  The museum began to reenter the field largely through the
                  efforts of Dudley Easby Jr., who joined The Met after World
                  War II. He had previously worked with Nelson A. Rockefeller in
                  the Office of Inter-American Affairs, the US governmental
                  agency promoting hemispheric solidarity during the 1940s to
                  counter German and Italian propaganda in Latin America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  From his post as the museum’s General Counsel, Easby was a
                  tireless advocate for the return of ancient American art to
                  The Met. At the invitation of the museum, Elizabeth
                  Easby—Dudley’s wife and a noted scholar of ancient American
                  art—prepared a report of The Met’s holdings of pre-Columbian
                  art, “forgotten treasures” that by now had long been on loan
                  to the AMNH and the Brooklyn Museum and featured in
                  exhibitions and publications internationally.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>

                  The return of ancient American art to The Met progressed in
                  fits and starts, however. In 1954, the museum hosted an
                  exhibition of pre-Columbian gold organized by Dudley and
                  Elizabeth Easby, an exhibition also shown in Washington and
                  San Francisco (fig. 7).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  A gallery dedicated to “pre-Columbian” art was first suggested
                  in 1956, but in that same year, Easby noted emphatically in
                  correspondence that the museum was not exhibiting
                  pre-Columbian art and that it did not have plans to do so in
                  the future, perhaps in light of the imminent opening of the
                  Museum of Primitive Art (see below).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Yet, by 1962, the tide had definitively turned. With the
                  support of James Rorimer, the director, Easby orchestrated the
                  return of the Brooklyn loans and initiated a campaign of
                  acquisitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  These included select purchases of monumental stone works,
                  textiles, and the cultivation of specific collectors, such as
                  Nathan Cummings, who eventually divided his collection of
                  Peruvian ceramics between the Art Institute of Chicago and The
                  Met. A selection of works from his collection was shown at The
                  Met from 1964 until 1969 (fig. 8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  These works were nominally cared for by the American Wing at
                  this time, in what a curator in that department described as a
                  “weird marriage of American decorative arts with pre-Columbian
                  art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  The ancient American collection became a source of contention
                  within the museum, as American Wing curators were increasingly
                  resentful of having to accommodate hundreds of new works over
                  which they had no say.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Easby and Rorimer persisted, however. Beginning in 1966, they
                  persuaded Alice K. Bache to donate a significant portion of
                  her collection of ancient American art. Trained as a sculptor
                  and painter in New Orleans before moving to New York to study
                  philosophy, Bache stands out against the sea of male
                  collectors and other women who collected in conjunction with
                  spouses or other family members. She worked closely with
                  archaeologists at the AMNH, including Junius Bird and Gordon
                  Ekholm, who advised her on purchases. She gave and bequeathed
                  numerous works to the AMNH and the Museum of the American
                  Indian (now the National Museum of the American Indian), but
                  she reserved the most important objects for The Met. Primarily
                  works of art in gold, the Bache gifts were transformative for
                  the collection. Indeed, the fine quality of the works surely
                  paved the way for the museum’s trustees to consider returning
                  to the field in earnest. At this point, plans were underway
                  for a permanent gallery for ancient American art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These plans were vastly expanded in 1969, however, when the
                  museum agreed to accept Nelson A. Rockefeller’s collection,
                  which included ancient American, Native American, African, and
                  Oceanic art—a grouping of disparate traditions by then
                  referred to under the rubric of “primitive art.” Appointed a
                  trustee of The Met in 1930, Rockefeller tried repeatedly over
                  the years to entice the museum to return to the field of
                  ancient American art. In 1939, he proposed that The Met join
                  with the AMNH to support archaeological expeditions in Latin
                  America to collect primitive art, a plan thwarted by Herbert
                  Winlock, The Met’s director at the time and an Egyptologist
                  determined not to let new interests distract the museum from
                  building up the Egyptian collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Continually rebuffed by The Met, Rockefeller turned to MoMA,
                  offering to establish a department of primitive art there in
                  1942.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  But Alfred H. Barr Jr., MoMA’s founding director, while happy
                  to host exhibitions of other-than-Western art, was adamant
                  that MoMA refrain from collecting in this area.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  With his plans rejected by both The Met and MoMA, Rockefeller
                  decided to create his own museum, following in the footsteps
                  of his mother, who, in similar circumstances, helped found
                  MoMA when The Met refused to collect or exhibit contemporary
                  art.

                <p>
                  Rockefeller began planning the new institution dedicated to
                  the arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indigenous Americas in
                  the late 1940s with the assistance and advice of René
                  d’Harnoncourt, who would later become the director of MoMA.
                  The Museum of Primitive Art (MPA), as it became known, opened
                  to the public in 1957 in a Beaux-Arts townhouse adjacent to
                  Rockefeller’s boyhood home on 54th Street, directly across the
                  street from MoMA (fig. 9). There was a clear synergy between
                  MoMA and the MPA, not surprising given that the two museums
                  shared governance, projects, and support from the Rockefeller
                  family. The gray stone facade was left unchanged, but the
                  interiors were converted into simple, minimalist spaces. Still
                  smarting from The Met’s decision decades earlier to exclude
                  pre-Columbian art from its holdings, Rockefeller was
                  deliberate in defining the purview of the MPA as “the
                  important art forms not included in The Met’s cognizance of
                  the past.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The MPA’s foundation documents, prepared in 1954, stress that
                  the MPA’s acquisitions and exhibitions would be limited to
                  objects of artistic excellence and would in no way attempt to
                  be representative in terms of anthropology.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  Works were to be presented as <em>fine art</em>, displayed in
                  a manner that was resolutely <em>modern</em>. Most works were
                  on open display—not in cases—a decision that, while
                  aesthetically striking, proved problematic at times (see
                  below). In the foundation documents, the institution is called
                  the Museum of Indigenous Art, but by the time the museum
                  opened three years later it had become the Museum of Primitive
                  Art. Rockefeller only reluctantly changed the name—his Mexican
                  friends did not like the new name at all—but “Indigenous”
                  apparently created confusion. In one account, Rockefeller
                  noted that the institution got mixed up with a new museum of
                  contemporary craft; elsewhere he recalled that people confused
                  “Indigenous” with “indigent.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>

                  D’Harnoncourt was deeply influenced by a starkly modernist
                  installation of a 1935 MoMA exhibition on African art
                  initiated by Barr and organized by James Johnson Sweeney (see
                  Koontz, this volume). The exhibition was one of a series of
                  what Barr called “primitive” exhibitions at MoMA, encompassing
                  <em>American Sources of Modern Art</em> in 1933 (fig.
                  10)—which included works from The Met’s collection—as well as
                  <em>Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art</em> in 1940 and
                  <em>Ancient Art of the Andes</em> in 1954. Robert Goldwater, a
                  noted historian of modern art with a strong interest in
                  African sculpture, had also worked on the 1935 African
                  exhibition (fig. 11). Brought in to be the first director of
                  the MPA, Goldwater expanded his concept of “affinity” for
                  gallery installations: Objects should be grouped by visual
                  form, not necessarily by subject matter or locale. Goldwater
                  was unapologetic about the decontextualization of works in the
                  MPA installations: “To put any of the world’s art in a museum
                  is to take it out of its intended environment.” No matter the
                  source, works possess inherent qualities “of skill, of design,
                  of expressive form and concentrated emotion that make it
                  <em>art</em>”—that render it accessible.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  The goal was to make the installations inviting and relevant
                  to modern tastes and interests.

                  The MPA exhibitions, all relatively small in comparison with
                  those at MoMA, were similarly minimalist in character, with
                  limited didactic information. The exhibitions were minimalist
                  in security matters as well. Perhaps not surprisingly, a small
                  Olmec figure went missing at the time of the first exhibition
                  (fig. 12). The paperwork surrounding the theft is fascinating.
                  The letter from Goldwater to Rockefeller apprising him of the
                  incident described the theft as likely the work of a
                  “crackpot” who left a note with the words “American degenerate
                  religious figure,” conjuring the specter of idolatry.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  The initial security report, however, says something slightly
                  different. The note had been placed next to the gallery’s
                  thermostat, and in a label-like format said, “AMERICAN,
                  DECADENT, probully [<em>sic</em>] of religious significance,”
                  echoing the label of the Olmec figure. It seems like an almost
                  Dada-esque joke on the pretensions of museum displays of
                  other-than-Western art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>

                  Although admittedly small—attendance at the MPA in 1964, one
                  of its peak years, was 18,365, while its neighbor across the
                  street received one million in the same year—it was
                  influential, and for the most part it enjoyed great critical
                  success.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  The <em>Art of Ancient Mexico</em> exhibition in 1961, for
                  example, was reviewed widely and enjoyed a spot on the
                  <em>Today</em> show on broadcast television. <em>The</em>
                  <em>New York Times</em> described the aesthetic value of the
                  works “demonstrably great,” while still holding on to ideas
                  that these civilizations were “baffling” and “mysterious.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Remojadas sculptures, with what many took to be their
                  seemingly overt expression of joy—a rarity in ancient American
                  art—continued to be favored in media oriented to the general
                  public (fig. 13).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The staff of the MPA, and Rockefeller himself, paid great
                  attention to design, from installations to invitations. The
                  publications in the early years were essentially elegant
                  checklists; it is only later that the exhibitions were
                  accompanied by serious scholarly contributions. Julie Jones,
                  the MPA’s first (and only) full-time curator for the arts of
                  the ancient Americas, produced
                  <em>The Art of Empire: The Inca of Peru</em> (1963); later,
                  working with Yale anthropologist Michael D. Coe, the museum
                  published
                  <em>The Jaguar’s Children: Pre-Classic Central Mexico</em>
                  (1965). These exhibitions were also the two most-attended
                  ancient American shows at the MPA.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  About half of the exhibitions at the MPA included works from
                  at least two, or usually all three, areas represented by the
                  museum. Of the single-area shows, a little over a third of the
                  exhibitions were dedicated to the arts of the ancient
                  Americas. In the later years, the idea was to have one show
                  from each area per year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the end, the MPA was open for seventeen years, during which
                  time the staff mounted some seventy exhibitions and published
                  nearly sixty books, catalogs, and gallery guides. By the late
                  1960s, however, the future of the MPA was in doubt.
                  Rockefeller’s son Michael, whom he had hoped would take over
                  as director, was lost on a collecting expedition in 1961. Some
                  four months after Michael’s death, d’Harnoncourt wrote to
                  Rockefeller about the future of the MPA, including questioning
                  who would be its director when Goldwater retired.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  Some scholars have suggested that Rockefeller wanted to close
                  the MPA for financial reasons, and indeed, parts of the
                  collection were put up at auction in 1967, ten years after the
                  museum had opened.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  The African works fetched robust prices, but many of the
                  ancient American works sold for well less than their initial
                  purchase price.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  While Rockefeller had hoped the MPA would become more
                  self-sustaining financially, money was not the impetus for the
                  dissolution of the institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other factors influenced Rockefeller’s thinking. In 1966, he
                  was running for a third term as governor of New York, and he
                  was increasingly seen as too rich and too removed from the
                  average New Yorker. The optics of art collecting surely did
                  not help in the opinion polls. Public opinion about collecting
                  archaeological material was also beginning to shift in the
                  mid-sixties, and this surely had a significant impact on
                  Rockefeller’s decision. The MPA received a letter in May of
                  1966 informing them that the Department of State had received
                  a diplomatic note from the Guatemalan embassy regarding the
                  return of Piedras Negras Stela 5, a work purchased from a New
                  York gallery in 1963.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  The subject of the art market’s relationship to the
                  destruction of archaeological sites was becoming an
                  increasingly important topic of public debate, and it
                  undoubtedly had an impact on Rockefeller’s impulse to collect
                  antiquities from Latin America, especially in light of what he
                  considered to be his very close relationship with that region
                  of the world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>

                <h2>Moving Uptown</h2>
                <p>
                  The reasons for MPA’s closure were ultimately
                  overdetermined.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Whatever the reason, or reasons, by the mid-1960s, it was
                  clear to the staff that Rockefeller had run out of
                  enthusiasm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  In the spring of 1967, d’Harnoncourt, Rockefeller, and Thomas
                  Hoving, who became director of The Met in April of that year,
                  gathered at Rockefeller’s Fifth Avenue apartment to discuss a
                  transfer of the MPA to The Met.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  This was a moment when The Met, led by an energetic new
                  director, was embarking on a massive expansion, including the
                  construction of new wings to house the Temple of Dendur and
                  the Lehman Collection. The proposed Rockefeller Wing would
                  become the final major expansion. Although The Met had been
                  cautiously reentering the field of ancient American art under
                  the previous two directors, Francis Taylor and James Rorimer,
                  Hoving made the decisive move, and on a grand scale.

                  The agreement was signed in 1969, and the announcement of the
                  transfer was made at a preview of an exhibition of some one
                  thousand works from the MPA that year (fig. 14). A
                  considerable critical and popular success, the exhibition
                  received over 170,000 visitors: about half the number the MPA
                  received during its lifetime.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  Accompanied by a catalog and a <em>Bulletin</em>—the cover
                  graced by a Remojadas figure—the exhibition was one of three
                  celebrating Rockefeller’s gifts of art to major institutions,
                  including MoMA.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  Rockefeller had finally triumphed at The Met, some forty years
                  after he first attempted to persuade the museum to return to
                  the field of ancient American art. In the following year, the
                  MPA celebrated The Met’s own collection of ancient American
                  art—a collection almost completely ignored by the uptown
                  institution for over half a century (fig. 15).

                  Easby stepped down as The Met’s General Counsel to become
                  chair of the newly formed department in 1969. Already in ill
                  health, however, his retirement from that post (“on or before
                  January 1, 1971”) was agreed upon by Rockefeller and The Met
                  in August of 1969.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  Goldwater and Douglas Newton, an MPA curator who was to become
                  chair of the new department at The Met, moved uptown shortly
                  after the transfer was announced in 1969. The MPA closed in
                  1974, and the remaining staff—including Julie Jones—library,
                  and collections also moved uptown.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  Of the 1,731 of works of African, Oceanic, and ancient
                  American art that were accessioned by The Met in 1979 (the
                  year Rockefeller died), nearly one thousand were from the
                  Americas—largely, but not exclusively, of the pre-Columbian
                  era.

                  By the time the MPA moved uptown, however, The Met had been
                  engaging with ancient American art for nearly a decade. With
                  the help of Elizabeth Easby, a consultant at The Met for the
                  Nathan Cummings exhibition in 1964 and acting curator at the
                  Brooklyn Museum between 1965 and 1968, the museum organized
                  several small exhibitions in the 1960s, as well as
                  <em>Before Cortés: Sculpture of Middle America</em>, an
                  ambitious project that included some three hundred works and
                  was seen by over three hundred thousand visitors (fig. 16).
                  The exhibition was part of a recent agreement between the
                  museum and Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Antropología e
                  Historia to exchange loans, the beginning of the museum’s
                  attempt to reckon with the growing concerns about how the art
                  market’s demand for antiquities was destroying archaeological
                  sites in Latin America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>

                  The Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, named in memory of Nelson’s
                  son, opened on January 19, 1982, three years after Nelson
                  himself died. Nearly half a million people visited the wing in
                  its first year, and critical reception was largely
                  positive.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Covering some forty thousand square feet on the museum’s south
                  side, the wing mirrored the glass enclosure of the Temple of
                  Dendur on the museum’s north side. The inaugural installation
                  drew from the spare installation style of the MPA, albeit with
                  more works behind glass (fig. 17). The theatrical lighting,
                  however, was perhaps the most striking feature of the new
                  galleries. Finished in a uniform beige, the galleries had
                  little ambient light, making the spotlights on sculpture quite
                  dramatic (fig. 18). Julie Jones became the first fulltime
                  curator of this field at The Met, a post she continued to hold
                  for almost forty years.

                  Ancient American Art at The Met: The First Hundred Years
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Although we often slide past this fact, most museum
                  collections are formed more through start-and-stop processes
                  rather than slow-and-steady ones. But, even if we recognize
                  that, the history of The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s
                  engagement with the arts of the ancient Americas is marked,
                  perhaps more than most, by periods of enthusiastic embrace
                  followed by stunning rejections. Initially celebrated as
                  American antiquities for an American museum in the nineteenth
                  century, only to be largely expelled from the institution for
                  much of the twentieth, pre-Columbian art returned to The Met
                  as <em>modern</em> in the 1960s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  The Met’s decision to reenter this field in the 1960s was
                  ultimately driven by multiple factors, including currents in
                  contemporary art and broader social issues, reminding us of
                  the complex interplay between specific individuals,
                  institutions, and shifting ideas about what is appropriate for
                  an American art museum.

                  As we embark on the first major renovation of the Michael C.
                  Rockefeller Wing in its forty-three-year history, my
                  cocurator, Laura Filloy Nadal, and I, along with our team,
                  continue to wrestle with this legacy. The place of works
                  created in the Americas prior to the European invasion within
                  museums continues to be the subject of debate. At the heart of
                  these debates is the question of what art <em>is</em>—in many
                  ways, a question that has been asked over the entire course of
                  The Met’s history. Do these objects belong in an art museum,
                  and if so, where? Increasingly, the debate centers on whether
                  these collections even belong in a museum, outside of the
                  lands in which they were made, a question that must also be
                  framed by a recognition of the rich constellations of cultural
                  heritage represented in New York’s social fabric. The Met’s
                  own history of ancient American art initially in, then out,
                  and then in again, as disconcerting as the history is at
                  times, should also serve as a reminder that museums are
                  living, evolving institutions, and that this capacity for
                  change should give us hope (fig. 19).

                    I thank Victoria Lyall and Ellen Hoobler for the kind
                    invitation to participate in this volume and for their
                    insightful comments on an earlier version of this essay.
                    This research would not be possible without the help of many
                    archivists and colleagues. At The Met Archive, this includes
                    Jim Moske, Melissa Bell, and Sarah Rappo, and Stephanie Post
                    in the Digital Department. In The Met’s Michael C.
                    Rockefeller Wing, I thank Matthew Noiseux and Paige Silva
                    for their help with the archives of the Museum of Primitive
                    Art. I am grateful to Natalie DeJesus, formerly of The Met,
                    for research assistance. I owe particular thanks to Jack
                    Meyers, president of the Rockefeller Archive Center, and his
                    staff, especially Michele Hiltzik Beckerman, Assistant
                    Director for Reference at the Center. Kelly Schulz,
                    Archivist, National Gallery of Art Archives, and Jennifer
                    Jolly, Ithaca College, were very helpful with my questions
                    about Dudley and Elizabeth Easby. Steve Odenheimer was
                    generous in sharing information about his aunt, Alice K.
                    Bache. Alicia Boswell, Ellen Hoobler, Rex Koontz, Victoria
                    Lyall, Mary Miller, Megan O’Neil, Matthew Robb, and Andrew
                    Turner have all kindly shared documents and ideas over the
                    years, for which I am very grateful. Most of all, I am in
                    debt to Ned Harwood, for everything.

                        attention to Thomas Hoving’s memoir, which contains an
                        alternative, and more self-serving view of the transfer,
                        placing the “coup” of landing the Rockefeller collection
                        later in time. Thomas Hoving,

                        Hoving exaggerated the success of the exhibition in
                        comparison to MPA visitorship at times, stating that The
                        Met’s show received more than the total number of
                        visitors to the MPA in its lifetime. The MPA received
                        329,890 in the seventeen years it was open. Hoving
