      Ancient American Art in a Borderlands City | Collecting the “Other
      Americas”
    </title>

    <meta name="description" content="The term *pre-Columbian art* once described the material culture produced in the Americas, mostly south of the US-Mexico border, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Museums across the United States now refer to these departments as art of *the Americas* or *the ancient Americas*. Stewards of these collections in American art museums have begun confronting the changing meanings and import of what Nelson Rockefeller once described as the “other Americas.” This symposium volume captures the history of collecting and display of ancient American works in art museums, a history surprisingly poorly documented until now.">

                  In the 1960s and 1970s, the Tucson Museum of Art found new
                  clarity in defining a vision of its future. After decades of
                  operating without a permanent collection, doing business under
                  various organizational names, and mounting an eclectic range
                  of exhibitions in rented quarters, the museum began to push
                  for a building of its own and to plan for an art collection,
                  and what was then called “pre-Columbian art” was foregrounded
                  as central to its purpose. Reporting on a gift of funds to
                  construct the new galleries, the
                  <em>Arizona Daily Star</em> noted that “the new museum is
                  expected to feature permanent collections of pre-Columbian,
                  Spanish Colonial, and contemporary Western art,” observing the
                  special relationship between the museum’s collection-to-be and
                  Tucson’s identity as a place of Mexican heritage.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Museum leadership believed that Tucson’s history should guide
                  their acquisitions, and the art of the Americas—and especially
                  ancient and colonial art from Mexico—became the institution’s
                  foremost priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This plan and mission for a new museum, however, were born
                  within a complex political and social reality. Tucson in the
                  1960s was a city in transition. Policies were enacted that
                  would fundamentally change the identity of downtown, where the
                  museum’s campus would ultimately be built. An urban renewal
                  plan, approved by Tucsonans in the mid-1960s, would condemn
                  and clear the neighborhood known as <em>la calle</em>, where
                  Mexican Americans and Mexicans had built a busy and culturally
                  connective commercial and residential district. In its place,
                  city leaders envisioned that new cultural spaces would
                  “modernize” Tucson, reconfiguring city blocks to eliminate
                  these homes and businesses and displace their residents. In
                  short order, the new museum, with its mission of collecting
                  Tucson’s Mexican past, would come to occupy a space within
                  that urban renewal footprint.

                <p>
                  Tucson is a Borderlands place, and because of this, new
                  initiatives can only intervene within a landscape that has
                  been multiply reinscribed across the region’s deep
                  history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Tucson is on the ancestral territory of Indigenous Sonoran
                  Desert communities. Southern Arizona was not part of a US
                  state but a territory until 1912, remaining so for more than
                  sixty years after California’s statehood, and it was Mexican
                  territory until the Gadsden Purchase of 1854. The city is only
                  an hour’s drive north of the border, and its built environment
                  and visual culture through the mid-twentieth century were
                  defined by Tucson’s relationship to Mexico. The Presidio,
                  built to house New Spain’s armies, once anchored the city
                  center, and in the surrounding neighborhoods, Sonoran-style
                  adobe structures housed downtown Tucson residents and
                  businesses. For all these reasons and more, Arizona historians
                  suggest that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
                  centuries, Tucson was largely perceived as Arizona’s “Mexican”
                  town—unlike Phoenix, where Spanish and Mexican armies never
                  settled and where anti-Mexican attitudes precluded what one
                  scholar described as Tucson’s unmatched “bicultural
                  vitality.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, many art museums across the country are increasingly
                  attentive to amplifying the resonances between the objects
                  that they steward and their local contexts. For institutions
                  that collect ancient American art, collections are
                  increasingly activated in collaboration with local Latinx and
                  Indigenous communities and their histories. At the time of the
                  collection’s founding, Tucson Museum of Art leadership
                  imagined that they would build a collection tied to regional
                  histories, acquiring works intentionally for their ties to
                  local people and place. Even so, closely attending to the
                  historical conditions in which that collection was formed
                  traces a more nuanced story about the relationship between the
                  museum and community. Most recently, this history also
                  includes initiatives in which the museum has sought to chart a
                  path forward in new, inclusive relationships with communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Turning momentarily to the first person: I worked at Tucson
                  Museum of Art as curator of the Latin American collections
                  from 2019 to 2024, where my colleagues and I were sensitive to
                  both the unique circumstances of the museum and the
                  distinctive relationship of the institution to its local
                  context. The museum is different in key ways from the other
                  institutions whose histories are studied in this volume. Its
                  collecting began relatively late, with the first acquisitions
                  of ancient American art coming only in 1965. It has never been
                  an encyclopedic museum, and so the ancient American
                  collections have never been asked to justify their importance
                  relative to other global ancient traditions. There are also
                  operational differences: The museum’s campus is small, its
                  staff lean, its resources modest. Yet even given these
                  differences, the Tucson Museum of Art’s history is important
                  to the broader picture of how ancient American art has been
                  collected and exhibited in art museums in the United States.
                  Its history tells how stewarding ancient American art became
                  entangled in a city’s broader renegotiation of its own
                  identity as a place of Mexican history, heritage, and culture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  Ancient American Art in Tucson Before the Tucson Museum of Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Long before the Tucson Museum of Art began acquiring objects
                  for its permanent collection, Tucsonans maintained broad
                  popular interest in the ancient Americas and in their city’s
                  relationship to the Mesoamerican past. The origins of the
                  connections between southern Arizona and Mesoamerica run deep.
                  Iconography from historical pottery of the Southwest shows
                  that by the 1300s, Indigenous artists of southern Arizona
                  created imagery representing ideologies shared with
                  Mesoamerican peoples, with common ideas and images circulating
                  beyond the delimitations of contemporary national borders.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Today, Indigenous collaborators in Tucson Museum of Art
                  curatorial projects continue to affirm ties between
                  southwestern heritage and ancient American visual cultures,
                  recognizing a common heritage in Mesoamerican art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Newspaper records of the early twentieth century show that
                  English-language audiences were interested in Tucson’s ties to
                  Mesoamerica—though the most spectacular account in this early
                  history was rooted in an archaeological fraud. In 1924, a
                  trove of lead crosses, swords, and other artifacts was
                  discovered by the city’s deputy sheriff while he explored a
                  lime kiln near a wash a few miles from downtown. Dozens of
                  additional objects were soon uncovered, several of which were
                  inscribed with Latin texts that were later proven to be
                  haphazard copies lifted from the classics. For years, local
                  authorities speculated that the artifacts might prove that
                  Tucson was the meeting place for ancient Toltec and Roman
                  soldiers, and no less a figure than George Vaillant
                  (1901–1945), then curator at Harvard’s Peabody Museum, was
                  brought to inspect the find site.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  The question of their authenticity was at last debunked by
                  1930, but the forgeries effectively generated years of local
                  interest in Tucson’s ties to Mesoamerica and the broader
                  world.

                  Indeed, Americanist archaeology played a significant role in
                  defining the regional identity of Tucson in the 1930s. In the
                  words of one reporter writing in the
                  <em>Tucson Daily Citizen</em> in 1937, “One of the strongest
                  lures of the Southwest is the historically fascinating field
                  it offers to the archaeologically minded. Not only does this
                  region provide limitless resources to the scientist, but the
                  layman is ever conscious of the ‘great discoveries’ as is
                  demonstrated by the many bones, pieces of pottery and other
                  objects which are turned into the State Museum for
                  inspection.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  Popular media brought news of excavations carried out in
                  Pueblo archaeology in northeastern Arizona, while the Arizona
                  State Museum in Tucson processed accumulations of scientific
                  and informally excavated materials.

                  While Tucsonans’ interest in the archaeology of the ancient
                  Americas is clearly attested in the early decades of the
                  twentieth century, sources on ancient art’s commercialization
                  during the same years are relatively quiet. By midcentury,
                  however, several galleries that specialized in ancient
                  American art operated in the city. Sheep rancher Clay Lockett
                  (ca. 1906/1907–1984) opened his Indian Arts and Crafts shop in
                  1942, marketing ancient American art and works in other
                  collecting categories to a Hollywood clientele. A photograph
                  documents a visit by actor Ralph Bellamy (1904–1991), who is
                  shown holding an ostensibly pre-Columbian ceramic work that he
                  purchased at the gallery (fig. 1). Oral histories recall that
                  noted collector Vincent Price (1911–1993) also paid a visit to
                  Lockett in search of ancient gold objects in the early
                  1960s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lockett was not alone in selling pre-Columbian art in
                  midcentury Tucson. Promotional announcements for galleries now
                  long defunct evidence the active trade in ancient American
                  artworks in the city. At a gallery called Shearman-Sierk,
                  photographs from 1962 document an installation in which west
                  Mexican sculptures hung alongside paintings by local artists
                  in the gallery’s inaugural exhibition, designed by the
                  University of Chicago–trained art historian Richard
                  Pelham-Keller.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Another gallery, America West Primitive and Modern Art, sold
                  pre-Columbian art under the direction of Tucson-born Princeton
                  graduate Kelley Rollings (1927–2018), who also offered works
                  in other categories to meet local interest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Also in town was Catherine Noble’s Mexican Shop, where 1956
                  saw a sale of “effigies and bowls recently brought back from
                  the Nayarit district.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  Decades later, the proprietors of several of these local
                  galleries would play a pivotal role in growing the museum’s
                  collection: Both Lockett and Rollings would donate to the
                  museum’s Latin American holdings, with Rollings gifting
                  Mesoamerican works to the growing collection in the 1970s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cumulatively, available sources suggest that in midcentury
                  Tucson, ancient American objects were largely marketed and
                  displayed as part of a cross-category decorative collecting
                  practice, bought and sold alongside what today we distinguish
                  as colonial Latin American art, Indigenous southwestern works,
                  Latin American folk art, and even art of the American West.
                  Interior photographs of Tucson homes suggest how consumers in
                  this market displayed these works together. Images show
                  ancient American objects like Nayarit figural sculpture
                  displayed alongside Mexican silver in colonial styles and
                  Indigenous historic pottery from the US Southwest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  The cross-category mingling of ancient American objects
                  reflected in such collection photos mirrors their movement
                  through the market.

                  In the same years when Tucson dealers and purchasers shaped a
                  collecting practice for the region, Tucson-area institutions
                  were also defining serious scholarly commitments to scientific
                  study of ancient Mexico. New learnings from these projects
                  identified scientific bases for shared histories between
                  Mesoamerica and the Southwest. East of the city, the Amerind
                  Foundation’s director, Charles Di Peso (1920–1982), was
                  engaged in excavations at Paquimé, Chihuahua, from the late
                  1950s into the 1960s in partnership with Mexico’s INAH
                  (Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia). Di Peso’s
                  excavations established that Paquimé was a point of
                  high-volume trade between Mesoamerica and the Southwest, a
                  place where scarlet macaws from Mesoamerica were husbanded in
                  the Chihuahua desert.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  More broadly, the Amerind’s projects were staking out a vision
                  in which Arizona and New Mexico might be posited as
                  Mesoamerica’s northernmost expression.

                  The local conditions described thus far—gallery sales of
                  pre-Columbian art, a decorative style incorporating ancient
                  American objects, extensive local reporting in the popular
                  press on Arizona Americanist archaeology, and archaeological
                  excavations tying the Southwest to Mesoamerica—all had a part
                  in defining Tucson’s relationship to the ancient Americas. Yet
                  none of this might necessarily have led to the creation of a
                  local museum collection of ancient American art. There was,
                  after all, no clear space for such a collection. The
                  University of Arizona Museum of Art had been energized in 1951
                  by a gift of Renaissance paintings from the Samuel H. Kress
                  Foundation; meanwhile, its civic analog, the Tucson Fine Arts
                  Association, which would later become the Tucson Museum of
                  Art, would not begin collecting in any category until 1959.
                  But that first gift would come from Frederick Rhodes Pleasants
                  (1906–1976), a prodigious collector, curator, and heritage
                  worker who became a leading force in the city’s cultural
                  sector (fig. 2). Singly, Pleasants would become the figure
                  most responsible for the institutionalization of ancient
                  American art history in the city.

                  Frederick R. Pleasants and the Founding of the Tucson Museum
                  of Art Collection
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Before arriving in Tucson, taking a position at the University
                  of Arizona to enjoy the health benefits of the desert,
                  Pleasants had developed a multifaceted career in museums and
                  heritage work. Trained at Princeton University as a specialist
                  in Maya art and archaeology, Pleasants organized exhibitions
                  at Harvard’s Peabody Museum in the 1930s, where a report from
                  the institution states that one display on the Americas
                  emphasized “the effect of environment on culture.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  World War II brought Pleasants to issues of restitution: As a
                  Monuments Man, he was appointed to head the Central Collecting
                  Point in Munich in 1946. His return from the war also brought
                  him back to the Peabody, and then to the Brooklyn Museum,
                  where he succeeded Herbert Spinden (1879–1967) as Curator of
                  Primitive Art from 1949 to 1956.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the Brooklyn years, Pleasants organized exhibitions
                  that perhaps best speak to his vision of the field. In a short
                  bulletin published by the museum, he laid out a plan for the
                  department that distinguished between what he termed “objects
                  of art” and “objects of anthropology.” Brooklyn would pay most
                  attention to art, with the purpose of working to “demonstrate
                  the special contribution of primitive art, its closeness to
                  technical processes, and its strongly motivated social
                  background as well as showing the best from an aesthetic
                  viewpoint.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  In his galleries, Pleasants grouped Aztec works with African
                  and Oceanic objects to suggest that all works had social
                  motivations. Visually, he pursued what he described as
                  “experimental display techniques” with modern lighting and
                  harmonious color schemes. A bibliographic note tells us that
                  in 1954, Pleasants spoke at a Wenner-Gren Foundation Supper
                  Conference alongside Alfred Kidder (1885–1963) and Linton
                  Sattherthwaite Jr. (1897–1978) where the topics included,
                  among other things, “The Role and Function of Museums,”
                  “Problems of Exhibition,” and “The Potentialities of
                  Television.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>

                  Alongside his museum work, Pleasants was also building a
                  personal collection. By his own account, he was motivated to
                  collect “primarily for teaching purposes,” an assertion that
                  aligns with his relatively pedagogical approach to presenting

                  The timeline and methods of his acquisitions, however, remain
                  obscure. By 1938, Pleasants’s name would be recorded as a
                  purchaser in the Brummer Gallery records, and in 1944, Brummer
                  sold Pleasants a Moche vessel now in Tucson’s collection (fig.
                  3). A textile in a hybrid Moche-Wari style (<a href="https://tucsonmuseumofart.pastperfectonline.com/webobject/196F19A8-4D18-11D9-BD9A-016751224300" target="_blank">2001.23.1</a>), also now at the museum, was almost certainly owned
                  previously by one of Pleasants’s Brooklyn contacts, the German
                  Peruvian dealer Guillermo Schmidt Pizarro (1880–1964), who
                  sold a related work to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in the
                  1930s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  Later in the Brooklyn years, Pleasants would also make his
                  most significant purchase, acquiring in 1950 a monumental
                  stone sculpture from Veracruz from gallerist Pierre Matisse
                  (1900–1989), who had been one of Pleasants’s contacts during
                  his years at the Peabody (fig. 4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Similar in style to the Lápida de Tepatlaxco, itself created
                  in the first millennium CE in an area near Orizaba, Veracruz,
                  the sculpture sourced from Matisse has now been identified as
                  among the first works to be sold by artist Diego Rivera
                  (1886–1957) on the international art market.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Matisse may also have been the source for another Pleasants
                  work, a stone <em>palma</em> from Veracruz that was previously
                  owned by governor of Veracruz Teodoro Dehesa Méndez
                  (1848–1936; fig. 5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  Today, we know that Dehesa’s relative had entrusted a number
                  of sculptures to Matisse for sale, suggesting that he could
                  have been the source for the Pleasants palma as well.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  This collection of details about specific acquisitions surely
                  underlies a broader picture of Pleasants as a collector,
                  although that picture remains to be further clarified.

                  While Pleasants’s collecting patterns are only beginning to
                  emerge, what is better documented is the sensational impact of
                  the collection once its owner moved to Tucson in 1958. Soon
                  thereafter, the Arizona State Museum mounted a 1962 exhibition
                  of his holdings. The show was accompanied by a published
                  catalog with listings of many of the definitive works from his
                  collection, suggesting that by that year, most of the major
                  acquisitions had already been made.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  In the wake of the exhibition, Pleasants began transferring
                  his collection to museums, and the Arizona State Museum
                  received several important objects, including important Andean
                  weavings. However, Pleasants evidently determined within a few
                  years that many gifts from his collection should be routed
                  toward an art-focused institution instead.

                <p>
                  In 1965, Pleasants transferred the Veracruz sculpture that he
                  purchased from Matisse to the Tucson Art Center, where he had
                  taken a position on the board. This donation was a remarkable
                  vote of confidence for an organization that at that point had
                  a collection of fewer than forty artworks, almost all of which
                  were works on paper. Even so, Pleasants envisioned that the
                  center might become a serious place for the study of
                  regionally significant art from periods before Arizona
                  statehood. In his words, he saw “a great opportunity to
                  develop a distinguished collection of both pre-Columbian and
                  Latin American Colonial art and to have both permanent and
                  temporary exhibitions of the finest examples of those arts
                  characteristic of Tucson and the Southwest.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Loans of additional objects, and then additional gifts,
                  followed: In 1972, Pleasants donated jades that had just been
                  published by the Emmerich Gallery (fig. 6), a Chocholá-style
                  vessel, and a Wari tapestry-woven tunic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  Pleasants also donated the foundations of a research library,
                  giving the young institution over two thousand scholarly
                  volumes and thousands of slides.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To exhibit the Veracuz sculpture and other Pleasants objects,
                  the Tucson Art Center quickly established a Primitive Art Room
                  in its rented quarters at the historic Kingan House in
                  downtown. Pleasants’s pieces were joined there by other loaned
                  works from Tucson collectors, including dealer Rollings and
                  Costa Rican art collector Frank Appleton. Because the gallery
                  was small, Pleasants planned a quickly rotating exhibition to
                  display a sequence of selected objects. For a few weeks, the
                  gallery highlighted works from what he called “nuclear
                  America,” which were then replaced by Costa Rican antiquities,
                  followed thereafter by Andean textiles, and so on.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  These years saw the Art Center’s director, E. F. Sanguinetti
                  (1917–2002), photographed in the
                  <em>Tucson Daily Citizen</em>, posed in a near-embrace of the
                  Veracruz sculpture to which he looked, in the words of the
                  reporter, with “obvious pleasure.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  As the institution’s collecting and exhibitions of ancient
                  American art built momentum, subsequent directors expressed
                  their elation at the prospect of making Tucson a center for
                  ancient American art. One interim director, Gerrit C. Cone,
                  remarked that the donation had inspired “a new faith in the
                  Art Center, its program and its staff.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In those years, the Art Center’s leadership was clear about
                  its commitment to forming what was envisioned as a
                  “distinctive regional museum featuring the legacy of
                  pre-Columbian and other primitive art, Spanish Colonial,
                  Western, and folk art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Rather than form an encyclopedic collection—an
                  impossibility—the museum chose to foreground local relevance,
                  focusing on areas important to the history of southern
                  Arizona. Such a regional focus would still allow for
                  international reach and collaboration. One hope was that when
                  the museum managed to secure a permanent building, it might
                  include a “Mexican Room,” a gallery for showing exhibitions
                  organized by Mexican museums.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  Little more than a decade later, the museum’s board would back
                  away from its regionalist focus.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  But in the late 1960s and early 1970s, ancient American and
                  colonial Latin American art centered their vision for the
                  future. Though it did not yet have a building, the institution
                  had an identity: It would define itself by its commitments to
                  Mexico and the Americas, conserving histories that made Tucson
                  distinctive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Enthusiasm for the Art Center’s mission and its formalization
                  as a museum was helped along by observers from the outside.
                  Dudley Tate Easby Jr. (1905–1973) and Elizabeth Kennedy Easby
                  (1925–1992), then at work organizing The Metropolitan Museum’s
                  monumental <em>Before Cortés</em> exhibition, came to Tucson
                  in 1969 and spoke approvingly of the institution’s intention
                  to focus on the ancient Americas. In Dudley Easby’s flattering
                  comments to Tucson press, by prioritizing this area, “the
                  center here would be doing what the Metropolitan Museum should
                  have been doing for the past 97 years.” He did not hesitate to
                  opine, though, on the intractable problem of financing the
                  center’s transition into a professional museum, criticizing
                  city government for failing to “face up to whether or not they
                  want an art center and start planning how to support it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>

                  A few years later, the Veracruz monument was photographed in
                  the news once again, this time as it was uncrated following
                  its return from <em>Before Cortés</em> (fig. 7). The loan was
                  heralded as a triumph: A piece from Tucson’s new collection
                  had shown alongside works from major international
                  museums.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  The enduring question, though, was how the Art Center might
                  grow into a more mature institution in its own right and
                  secure a new, fixed home. True to its institutional identity,
                  the museum would look to the ancient American collection as
                  part of the strategy that promoted its growth. That growth,
                  however, meant intervening in a downtown environment where
                  Tucson’s identity as a Borderlands place was being
                  renegotiated.

                <h2>Urban Renewal and Tucson’s Ancient American Collection</h2>
                <p>
                  The years when the Tucson Art Center’s attention turned
                  decisively to ancient American art were also pivotal years in
                  the story of downtown’s changing identity. Until the
                  mid-1960s, Mexican American and Mexican communities made
                  downtown Tucson a busy urban center, alongside Indigenous and
                  Chinese immigrant communities. In the district that residents
                  called la calle—located around one of Tucson’s main
                  thoroughfares of the time, Meyer Avenue—Mexican American
                  Tucsonans ran businesses in mixed-use structures, some of
                  which were built during the city’s Mexican period in the first
                  half of the nineteenth century. Community spaces offered
                  places to gather. La Placita, the community’s public square,
                  hosted celebrations for patron San Agustín, and the nearby
                  Plaza Theater screened Spanish-language films produced across
                  Latin America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1964, however, the city of Tucson began working on an urban
                  renewal plan that would displace most of the residents of la
                  calle. In a meticulous study of the fate of the district,
                  historian Lydia Otero noted both the process and rhetoric of
                  this project. A decades-long effort had labeled the homes and
                  businesses of downtown’s Mexican Americans as “slums,”
                  preparing the way for their condemnation and removal. Cultural
                  institutions were implicated in this plan; period documents
                  suggest that the plan was that once the existing district was
                  cleared, Tucson could rebuild with a “good cultural base,” in
                  the words of the Commission on Municipal Blight.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A number of influential voices opposed this plan. Otero has
                  shown, for example, that the publisher of the
                  <em>Arizona Daily Star</em> urged caution, writing: “Must the
                  people of Tucson destroy this remaining area of former Mexican
                  life just because the streets are too narrow and buildings
                  old? . . . Maybe someday Tucsonans would look back at urban
                  renewal and wonder why they authorized such a project which
                  wiped out at one stroke what remained of Mexico in
                  Tucson.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  These concerns notwithstanding, voters approved the plan, and
                  la calle fell to urban renewal. The essential votes passed in
                  1966, just months after the Art Center acquired its Veracruz
                  sculpture.

                  The private Art Center’s need for a new space to meet its
                  ambitions intersected with the city’s interest in building up
                  a “cultural base” downtown, and director Sanguinetti began
                  expressing his wish to benefit from the project to the press
                  in 1965. If given a square block within the urban renewal
                  footprint, he noted, the museum could “enrich community life
                  and would provide a historical, psychological, and cultural
                  focus around which the whole city might pulse.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  Ultimately, for a rent of a dollar a year, the museum would be
                  allowed to build within the boundaries of Tucson’s historic
                  Presidio, dating to 1775 when Tucson was part of New Spain, at
                  a site that had once held an ancestral pit house nearly two
                  millennia ago (fig. 8).

                  The most visible architectural embodiment of Mexican history
                  at the new museum’s site was the home occupied by María
                  Navarrete Cordova (1896–1975) and Raúl Cordova (fig. 9). A
                  Sonoran-style structure with architecture that partly predated
                  the Gadsden Purchase, the Cordova House was the living home of
                  a notable family of la calle. Through eminent domain, the city
                  condemned the home, a decision that the Cordovas tried for
                  years to reverse in court.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  As the museum took its place at the site, it would lease the
                  Cordova’s home, becoming responsible for caring for the
                  structure for the next one hundred years and planning gallery
                  construction for the lot immediately adjacent.

                  The Tucson Art Center was thus set on a path to build a home
                  for its new collections at a place central to the Mexican
                  identity of the city. Seeking funds to advance the project,
                  ancient American artworks became the visual icons of the
                  building fund, aligning the construction that would take place
                  near the Cordova House with the image of a future home for the
                  “pre-Columbian.” Pleasants’s Veracruz sculpture was the image
                  selected for the poster soliciting financial support (fig.
                  10), and a drawing of the palma appeared on the sign that
                  stood in front of the Building Fund’s downtown offices. The
                  campaign’s iconography underscores that highlighting the
                  museum’s ancient American collection was seen as the way to
                  secure its future within the urban renewal footprint.

                <p>
                  The new museum opened at last in 1975, and with it came a name
                  change to the Tucson Museum of Art (TMA). Galleries featured
                  artworks from Mexico, including works from the ancient
                  Americas, and next door, the Junior League funded restoration
                  to the Cordova House, converting it from a contemporary
                  Mexican American home and commercial space to a period room of
                  nineteenth-century Mexican Tucson, effectively erasing the
                  experience of the home’s most recent residents.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Urban renewal’s effects on Mexican American communities in
                  Tucson were deeply felt, and the memory of this displacement
                  is still articulated by community members today. Otero
                  documents a sentiment often expressed in the city: Downtown
                  left behind its Mexican American community, choosing to invest
                  instead in an idea of an economically vigorous center that in
                  reality failed to compete with the city’s suburban
                  expansion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  No single narrative neatly encapsulates the museum’s role in
                  downtown’s changing identity. While the museum’s galleries and
                  collecting looked to preserve material histories of Tucson’s
                  relationship to Mexican identities and the ancient American
                  past, that narrative was presentable only because the museum
                  had benefitted from the urban renewal project. Conserving
                  historical and ancient Latin American arts was, and remains, a
                  meaningful project for communities of the Southwest, but the
                  environment in which the spaces for the permanent collection
                  were born broadly displaced Mexican American communities from
                  participation in many aspects of downtown’s vitality. These
                  conditions make showing ancient American art in the
                  Borderlands distinctive: The collection resonates with the
                  identity formation of local communities, but its presentation
                  could only be possible through intervention into a landscape
                  of layered histories and conflicting interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The museum early on sincerely embraced and played a role in
                  fostering local Mexican American traditions, taking on
                  projects that gave it a role in preserving the heritage of la
                  calle alongside ancient American and colonial Latin American
                  artworks. From its early years, it imagined itself as a place
                  for Mexican Americans to gather. Every year beginning in the
                  1970s, Tucsonan María Luisa Tena and members of prominent
                  Mexican American Tucsonense families organized a nativity
                  scene, <em>El Nacimiento</em>, in the Cordova House, welcomed
                  with a community procession. Tucson mounted exhibitions in its
                  first decades of works by contemporary Chicano artists, and in
                  1992, it hosted the landmark exhibition
                  <em>Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation</em> (CARA). These
                  kinds of activities became part of a new image of cultural
                  identity in Tucson, in which the ancient American collection
                  played a part, though spatial tensions endured.

                  Over time, the museum’s relationship to its ancient American
                  collections changed. By 1983, it appears that some board
                  members had already begun to feel that the museum’s vision of
                  a “distinctive regionalism” might have been too restrictive.
                  An attempt to formalize the collecting policy to limit the
                  museum to what it called pre-Columbian, Spanish colonial, and
                  western art evidently met with displeasure, as an appetite was
                  growing for the museum to embrace contemporary art. Director
                  Andrew Maass was compelled to negotiate the identity of the
                  museum in the press. He said, “I think we are a regional
                  museum with a responsibility to present its collections and
                  its exhibitions with a regional focus. . . . Here’s a
                  regionalism for the West. I don’t think it’s anything to be
                  scared of.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  A new gallery for the ancient American collections was
                  installed that year to great acclaim, expanding to a roomy new
                  presentation in the finally finished building (fig. 11).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2001, the museum installed a new presentation of ancient
                  American art, positioning the field within a new conceptual
                  frame, along with a historical architectural one. Artworks
                  from Latin America, ancient to contemporary, were newly
                  brought together and reinstalled in another of the Presidio’s
                  historic houses, an adobe structure built in 1865. Reconceived
                  by Joanne Stuhr, Americas curator from 1993 to 2003, the Latin
                  American galleries emphasized Mesoamerican heritage as part of
                  the Arizona-Mexico regional identity. The following year,
                  Stuhr led TMA in originating an exhibition of Casas Grandes
                  ceramics,
                  <em>Talking Birds, Plumed Serpents and Painted Women</em>. The
                  exhibition was a collaboration with INAH archaeologists and
                  the Amerind Foundation that again emphasized the regional
                  relevance of ancient Mesoamerican traditions. Latin American
                  art projects were advanced in the following years by curators
                  Stephen Vollmer (2004–06), Fatima Bercht (2007–09), and Anna
                  Seiferle-Valencia (2010–12).

                  The end of the 2010s brought new approaches to the ancient
                  American collection, as well as a reckoning with the history
                  of the Cordova House. New galleries were planned for TMA’s
                  ancient American collections, the first expansion of the
                  museum’s physical footprint since 1983. Around the same time,
                  the Cordova House was newly reinterpreted—this time, with the
                  collaboration and cooperation of descendants of the Mexican
                  American community affected by the urban renewal and with
                  didactic panels explaining how urban renewal changed downtown
                  Tucson. For the first time since its displacement, María
                  Navarrete Cordova’s portrait returned to the Cordova House,
                  reinserting the family and the memory of la calle into its
                  narrative (fig. 12).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  From 2019 to 2024, I was responsible for TMA’s Latin American
                  collections. The museum’s commitment to art from the region
                  grew in those years with the construction and opening of the
                  Kasser Family Wing of Latin American Art in 2020, a project
                  that expanded galleries for the collection and focused
                  exhibitions. Ancient American collections were foregrounded in
                  the project, now expanded with gifts from I. Michael and Beth
                  Kasser and Paul L. and Alice C. Baker. At the project’s
                  outset, the museum’s approach to objects of heritage had
                  already begun to evolve in light of the experience of
                  reinterpreting the Cordova House and recontextualizing the
                  Indigenous North American arts collections. Curating new
                  ancient American galleries meant developing a project that
                  created community participation, collaboration, and a
                  polyvocal approach. Texts authored by community members with
                  heritage relationships to the ancient Americas appear
                  alongside exhibited objects, and curatorial interpretations
                  have sought to amplify connections between works and the
                  specific histories of Latinx communities in Tucson.

                  This approach has also characterized temporary exhibitions of
                  ancient American art pursued in recent years. To take one
                  example, the city became home to many Guatemalan refugees in
                  the 1980s, and a 2023 exhibition
                  <em>Popol Vuh and the Maya Art of Storytelling</em> presented
                  ancient objects in light of the words of community members,
                  who shared ideas about the relationship of narrative arts to
                  heritage, alongside commissioned art by contemporary artist
                  Justin Favela (fig. 13). A large-scale feature exhibition of
                  Andean cloth,
                  <em>CUMBI: Textiles, Society, and Memory in Andean South
                    America</em>
                  (2023–24) looked at weavings across time (including many
                  donated by Pleasants) and displayed the work of contemporary
                  textile artists of Andean heritage who practiced in or had
                  ties to the Southwest. Today, the museum works to fulfill a
                  vision of connecting ancient American art with Tucson’s
                  community that was intended at the collection’s founding but
                  with a new commitment to inclusion that charts the way
                  forward.

                        In using the term “Borderlands” to describe the context
                        of Tucson’s cultural politics, I invoke the work of
                        theorist and poet Gloria Anzaldúa, with particular
                        reference to her reflections on existence in this region

                        Lute, 1987). Anzaldúa’s work addresses the identity of
                        subjects in relation to the geographic boundaries of
                        national borders, as well as the shifting and emerging
                        psychological and creative space of the region as
                        informed by its intersecting, multiple histories.
