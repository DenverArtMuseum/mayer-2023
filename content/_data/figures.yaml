    alt: "A black-and-white advertisement that reads “The Famous Toltec Smiling Heads in the Petich’s Old Mexican Collection.” Under the title, two rows of photographs show smiling ceramic heads. Beneath those photos, the text reads: Petich’s old Mexican Collection has been pronounced by the foremost archaeologists, both American and from Europe, as the most startling one of its kind after the collection of the Museum in Mexico City. But notwithstanding its great value the ten Toltec Heads, which have been called the Mexican Tanagras, and whose exact copies in plaster we can now offer to the public, have been judged more valuable, more “absorbingly interesting” in themselves than all the other 1610 previous objects of which said collection is composed.  It would be impossible even to quote the many expressions of admiration that these heads have called forth from newspapers, reviews and scholars. After centuries of smiling at the skeletons of their masters under their native tumulus they were permitted to smile at the sons of a far later civilization, from the shelves of the Metropolitan Museum of Art to which the owner generously loans all such treasures."

    alt: "A page from Vogue magazine dated October 15, 1961. It reads:  Vogue’s Eye View: How old is a smile? This particular smile is about 1200 years old. It belongs to one of a group of Mexican clay figurines about which very little is known—except this: they are among the few ancient sculptures that show the human face smiling, even laughing. It’s not the enigmatic “ancient smile” (really a half-smile) of Greek or early Christian sculpture, but a natural, delighted grin of pure glee—imperishably fresh and charming. What was so funny in 700 A.D.? We’ll never know. There wasn’t any threatening nuclear cloud—but there was war, famine, pestilence. Eventually, one or all of these obliterated the people and the culture that produced this little head. But the smile remains. “Smiling Head,” Mexican clay Remojadas figure of about 700 A.D.; from the current exhibition, “Art of Ancient Mexico,” at the Museum of Primitive Art, New York City, through November 19.

    alt: An advertisement in the newspaper for a Pre-Columbian Art Sale/Exhibition. It shows various stone and ceramic artworks from the exhibition with the dates, April 10-22. The text beneath reads,  May-D&F presents one of the largest and most comprehensive showings of Pre-Columbian art ever assembled in this country. See this exhibition beginning tomorrow in the downtown store, second floor gallery.  Approximately 2,000 pieces have been selected and purchased under the personal supervision of Mr. Morton D. May, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the May Department Stores Company. The items have been carefully authenticated and dated by Mr. Alan R. Sawyer, Director of the Textile Museum, Washington D.C. Dr. Henry B. Nicholson, Associate Professor of Anthropology, UCLA expertised the Mexican stone pieces.  There is a wealth of art from Mexico and Peru interspersed with pieces from Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador. Many of the pieces have been determined to be of excellent museum quality. Viewing this collection of art from about 900 BC through the fifteenth century is an adventure for anyone. Pottery is in abundance in human and animal shapes. Stone, wood, gold and other metals are represented. Particularly outstanding is a collection of jade, stone and metal jewelry. Ancient Peruvian textiles are a strong part of the exhibition which ranges in price from $5 to $8,000. The art of Central America and the West Coast of South America, dating before Columbus’ discovery of America, has long been recognized as one of the highest artistic achievements of man. It is perhaps the favorite art form of people in this Rocky Mountain Empire, because of the early Spanish heritage of the land and because of the excellent collection in the pre-Columbian gallery in the south wing, Denver Museum of Art.  This pre-Columbian exhibition is one of a continuing series of various art forms and origins which May D&F makes available to the people of the Rocky Mountain area.
