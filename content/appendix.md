Dear Dad:
Stopped at lumber yard and got plywood for box on way home from Grandmothers and had Picasso at airport by 6 o’clock. It probably will be delivered at Jaffees before noon on Wednesday. Most of the information should be on back of photo. Reproduced full page in “Picasso” by Zervos Vol 11 page 201 – was in collection of Roger Fry. 

Got check from Ericson for $550 also your letter today with $250 from Reis. 

Glad you are not letting them beat you down of our choice Mayan figures. Too bad you don’t have some of the others to play with. Stolper came in today and said that Carlbach had phoned him all excited and up in the air about the figures and wanting to know if Bob could get some for him. Bob said he was too busy and to buy them from you but Carlbach said that he couldn’t touch them at the prices but wants a whole collection. He also wants Bob to take him to Mexico. 

Peterson sent up an article saying that 5 Mayan codices and some fine vases have just been discovered in the Campeche area. Don’t know whether this is Government or not or if it came from Jaina but he says that everyone is Mayan crazy in Mexico. I suppose we were damned lucky to get what we did at our price. Wish we could keep in closer touch with Campeche and skim off some more cream even with Hauswaldt and Echaniz. 

I wrote for and got some reactions from the last three outfits that had our show in the South. Just words.

Sutter brought back Sweeneys figure today and I will ship their stuff tomorrow. Sam Marx called today on route ~~fom~~ to Chicago from trip around world. Couldn’t persuade him to come up and see the stuff but he expects to see you in Chicago. The architect John Rex’s partner was in and very impressed tonight – they rent Frankls old place and are doing great business.

Joe got a great order today setting up a new plant. Stein will have a fit when he sees it. Am inclosing a letter about Wendts – you can call him in Chicago. Wish you were going to St Louis but it might not be worth it as long as they have things still outstanding. Got $100 knocked off plumbing bill.

Rocky is swimming now and Roney can really plow through ~~watter~~ water both on top and underneath. It is late now and Picasso will beat this letter. Hope you can out chis~~s~~el Jaffee. He once bought a~~t~~ stone piece from us for $75.

Dear Earl:

Enclosed find two (2) gold items which I drove to Laguana and picked up from Phil Dade. Large piece with bone or ivory insert - - NET TO PHILS $1,500.00. Small double head animal --NET TO PHIL - - $300.00. 
I had him call his sister in the East and w she will deliver to you 2 or 3 Cocle style breast plates. These are NET TO PHIL at $12,00 per Gram. 

Al and I both upset about the $7,000.00 Amlash clay figure. 

George Kennedy was in New York a short time ago and said that Francis Pratt had some great things, Maya bowls and Olmec.

Also that Furman has a Stela from Guat. that he has priced at $60,000.00. Take a look at both of these places.

Dr. Kaiser and his wife were down last week from Berkeley. Came in at 3 in the afternoon Sat and did not leave until 3 in the morning. What a session. They purchased $12,500.00. , of which will pay $5,000.00 in the spring and the rest later. A good deal for us. Eleanor and I go to Midland on Thursday next week to have Thanksgiving dinner with Rock and will continue on to Berkeley to deliver the things. Also to seethe other two couple up there. I am sure that they will all turn into excellent clients. Also think that I can seel the Mosaic Jaguar to the one couple but if you feel you need it back there and have a chance to sell it, I can make another trip later. Am looking trying to find something to sell Adriana in Carmel but as yet have found nothing. 

[illegible words crossed out] Al just went to Scripps to deliver a talk to open the show. 

lso the 3 couples up North (Berekely) were most impressed with our Otis show and think that the Village would be a great thing for the New Oakland Museum. What is your idea price-wise on the entire village as we had it set up at Otis? I could start negoations on this next weekend. 

Thats all as I want to get this and gold in mall immediately.

Joe

Dear Enid,  

Somebody cut off our telephone B4 I had finished so I am writing the news as of the passed week. Ernest just left after a lovely steake dinner and I have just finished the dishes.

I deposited the check from Tomayo 400.00 also the 500.00 check from the woman in Cleveland of the Sasanian ring. Also a check from Heeramanic of 500.00 for the little Islamic bracelett wich was stolen from us. 

Was walking home with Ernest one evening and he met a friend of his a Mr. Dr. Arthur Sackler. We took him up to the appartment and he had a very exciting evening looking at our treasures. He liked the larg Amlash bull. The next day he had Frank Caro come in to pass on it. Caro and his son were as much excited as he was. Today Dr. Sackler came in and bought it for $12000.00. Also the Jaguar head from Guatemala for $1200.00. He also reserved the small gold cup from Persia for $6000.00. He would rather have the larger cup for $15000.00 but this is the one Rothcield of Paris reserved. If Rothcild dose not take it he will. He also wants me to get a lot of other things for him. He will start paying after Jan 1st.

Dockstader reserved for two weeks the following items. Double bottom bowl 5000.00

Seated figure- 3500.00

And green mask- 1500.00

Evidently the Dr. Sackler will put up the money

for these as he gave the Museum of American Indian money for purchases- so you see we have been pretty busy and I am just a little tired.

Mrs michel sent me a dozen white Roses with a nice card- And Jean Michell sent me two casees of wisky - one case 12 bottle of sckoch-pinch bottle and 12 bottles of of 100 proof Old Grandad in full quartes. Also he wanted to give me a dinner at Luchos for my friends so I invited- Easby & wife, Gordon Ekolm and wife Jane Powel and husband of the Booklin Museum and Ernest and Miss Jones of the Primitive. We were able to drink all the schoch and old Fashion with two 12.00 bottles of Rothcilds wine and cavear ect. The dinner must has come to over $125.00. Ever one had a good time-

Also Michell gave me $80.00 to go to Europe to try to buy the gold from my friend in Geneva and also to try to buy the gold helmet a man as in Lucern - If I can get there I can add on 20%. I phoned Carl Curtis for the two pieces he had from a friend, but they we sold the day after I saw them. He will try to get the two pieces from Friedman. He was supposed to phone me, but did not so I think it was no go. he might write to you as he has not my N.Y. Adress-

I am leaving Sunday at 7:30 P.M and will be in Geneva about 1030 AM Monday. Will call Stole and try to see Mr & Mrs Wm Barzier. Will then go to Zurich and Lucern there Paris and back to N.Y. Have Reservation to leave NY on the 23 and should be home about 7:30 P.M. Flight 11 T. W. A.

[Earl L. Stendahl letterhead]

Feb 22–1965

Dear Al & Joe 

Arrived in Minnapolis and was only able to see Mr. Samuel Sacks II-as the director was busy. Sacks II is the top man any way so everything was O.K. 

Interested in Stone Panels in Large Room – No-8560 the standing Astec figure top of stairway – 2000.00 and the Bronze vase we got in Biblos. I will send the photos from here. 

In Chicago Raymond Wielgus wants the Mayan Bowl with face ~~and~~ we had at the Primitive. He just about commited himself $2000.00. I will send this to him. 

Wardwell of the Art Institute just about committed himself on No-10015 the blond incised Mayan Cylinder Bowl - $3000.00. 

Phoned Detroit and the curator Francis W. Robinson requested bill for the two Amlash pieces 1000.00 less than what we quoted. I gave him an option of one week on the Maya stone of which they have the Blow up. Quoted him 28000.00 down from 35000.00. If they don’t buy he will send blow up on to Minneapolis. He will send to me in N.Y. the gold plate. 

Jan Mitchel was in today with instruction about the gold and painting in Europe. He is hot. Hope you and Joe can do something on an exchange with the Mex Museum. Have sent you a catalogue of the large Egyptian Collection Sathoni has. The Met has 5 or 6 of the items under consideration. The catalogue is no good as it was printed in Egypt. We could have it all sent out

as it would make a good study colechon for the University. Have been sorting photos all day and bought two good Amlash pieces from Sabhoni for $300.00. His niece is here going to N. Y. U. and brought them with her. He might send out a few pieces for repair. I gave him also 250.00 for ring we sold to our Detroit man who has not paid. Tuesday will make an appoinment with Abrams and also phone Washington.

The people from Toronto-Mr & Mrs Noah Torno 146 Bloor Street West, Toronto 5-Canada. Send them a group of catalogus. They are hot.

The Cohens will come in about Middle of week and I know they will buy.

Dr Arthur Sackler was to come in late today but left B4 I phoned him at 4:30. Glad you got a check from Dayton. Hope Tom will do like wise. Will also phone Cleveland and Lef heramanac is in hospital from a stroke. Alie Lewin is not intown as his phone has been temporarily disconected.

Docksteder is in Winapeg Canada till the end of the week. Mitchel will give me two hundred for the Blue clay piece. He would like to have us send the Egption box with the polychrome figure insid but I am afraid he would not buy after seein gthe condition its in.

Love to all
Dad.

Thurs. P.M.

[Hotel de la Paix letterhead]

Dear Relatives –Your letter today. Eleanor thought I asked you to open the packs – <u>please do</u> – your “Blumen” are therin – 2 peasant aprons for you two kitchen wenches (if you want them) a pepper mill for ME – 2 sheep horns – Linden & Leslie– You seem to be busy enough –
The Spratling Trouble: He phoned – & came to breakfast – Tue a.m. – Said he had this stone – from Vera Cruz. Has been in a dark warehouse 2 years – René D__ a count was to buy it, but wired a curt, negative No. Stone in several pieces – about impossible to see. Now will take $4000 for it – he & papa each take 1⁄2 – Papa say he will buy it – sight unseen for $4000 – trouble usually comes otherwise. But – Bill had a date at 11.30, with Emmerich – to see Stone-

Papa say he will go halves with Emmerich - Bill departs, saying he will call in the P.M. By that time, Papa mad. Says with all we have done for Bill - he shows stuff to others first– and as this stone has probably ben peddled about–he will not take-So– when Bill called, asking us to breakfast Wed. A.M. (Westbury). . Papa just say–"Two g.D. Early" and hangs up-So-we do not know the Emmerich decision- It was a covering for an opening in a Cave - <u>very</u> heavy- Would have been something to handle - saw a drawing-head of a tiger design. They both took "cracks" at Easby - Goldwater of Primitive— and a <u>touch</u> at Eckholm!
